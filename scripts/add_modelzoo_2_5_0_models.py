"""Emit the 147 DX Model Zoo 2_5_0 additions into every file that describes them.

Outputs, all generated and none of them a source:

    config/model_registry.json          +147 entries, +'published' on all of them
    tests/data/processor_specs.json      +147 entries
    tests/data/modelzoo_cv_tree.json    'provisional' section (147)
    scripts/modelzoo_manifest.json      +147 rows

The single source is scripts/data/modelzoo_2_5_0.py. Change a family name there and
re-run this; never hand-edit the four files above.

Idempotent by construction: every row this script owns is REMOVED and re-inserted
rather than patched in place. That matters because the predecessor was bitten for real
-- renaming a registry field to 'alias_of' while the emitter only stripped the NEW
field names left 'duplicate_of' alive in all 353 entries, so two spellings coexisted.
Deleting first makes a rename impossible to half-apply.

Existing entries keep their exact position: the registry's 353 rows are NOT sorted (nor
sorted case-insensitively), so re-ordering them would produce a huge, meaningless diff
and bury the real change. New rows are appended, sorted by variant.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/add_modelzoo_2_5_0_models.py                 # write
    python3 scripts/add_modelzoo_2_5_0_models.py --snapshot-only # provisional section only
    python3 scripts/add_modelzoo_2_5_0_models.py --check         # exit 1 if a write would change anything
