"""Enforce i_registry.hpp rule 1: the engine never names a concrete registry
and never switches on a task string.

Reviewers forget. This does not. But read the "What this guard cannot catch"
section below before trusting it as a complete substitute for review — it is
a tripwire, not a parser.

Design note (Task 1's lesson): an earlier guard in this project used a regex
strategy that silently skipped files it could not parse, so a violation
sitting in one of those files passed unnoticed. To avoid repeating that:

  * This guard does not use a fixed list of "engine filenames" to check. It
    walks every .hpp/.cpp/.h/.cc file under common/graph/ (recursively) and
    checks all of them, except the test/ fixtures, which legitimately define
    and reference a concrete FakeModelRegistry. A new engine file added later
    (a new executor, a new router variant) is covered automatically — it does
    not need to be added to an allowlist for the guard to see it.
  * A file this guard cannot read (decode error, permission error, etc.) is
    reported as a GUARD FAILURE, never silently skipped. "Passed because it
    saw nothing" is treated as worse than "failed loudly".
  * An empty or missing common/graph/ directory is also a guard failure, not
    a silent pass — a guard that finds zero files to check and reports
    success is indistinguishable from a guard that is no longer wired up.
  * The patterns below deliberately over-match (several spellings of "the
    engine compares a task string" and "the engine names a concrete
    registry") rather than pinning to the exact identifiers used in this
    project's current code, because the next violation will not necessarily
    be spelled StaticModelRegistry or `task == "..."`.
  * This guard does not strip comments before scanning, on purpose: a
    comment-stripping regex is itself exactly the kind of "parser" that can
    silently misparse a file and hide a violation inside a string literal or
    an unusual comment style. Scanning raw text means a violation quoted
    inside a comment produces a false positive a reviewer has to wave
    through — worse than that would be a violation hidden by a stripping
    step that got a file wrong.

What this guard CATCHES:
  * A concrete registry type/symbol named or included in an engine file,
    however it is spelled (ModelRegistry/OperatorRegistry suffix, snake_case
    *_registry, or a bare #include of it) — two independent mechanisms:
      1. ENGINE_INCLUDE_ALLOWLIST / _resolve_include() / _include_violation():
         an engine file's #include is resolved the way this project's own
         compiler resolves it (against every -I root src/cpp_example/
         CMakeLists.txt wires up — see INCLUDE_ROOTS), quote or
         angle-bracket, identically; if it resolves to a real file inside
         this repo, that file's path must be on the allowed surface. A
         concrete registry renamed to something with no "registry" in its
         name or filename at all (e.g. a class `Zoo` in `zoo.hpp`) is still
         rejected because `zoo.hpp` was never on ENGINE_INCLUDE_ALLOWLIST —
         name-blindness does not help it, and spelling the include with
         `<>` instead of `""` does not help it either, because resolution
         does not branch on the quote character. An include that does NOT
         resolve to a real file is a VIOLATION unless it is recognizably
         external (KNOWN_EXTERNAL_HEADERS/KNOWN_EXTERNAL_PREFIXES) — this
         is fail-closed, not fail-open: an earlier draft guessed "internal"
         only for text that started with a known-internal prefix and let
         anything else through, which let a bare-relative phantom include
         (`#include "zoo_config.hpp"`, no internal-looking prefix, file not
         on disk) evade it; now the only way an unresolvable include is
         allowed is by matching the closed, short list of what this project
         genuinely depends on externally (the C++ standard library, OpenCV,
         dxrt), so a phantom internal header a codegen step hasn't produced
         yet is correctly flagged the same as any other bare relative
         include this guard has never heard of.
      2. REGISTRY_IN_INCLUDE_PATH: independently, any include path
         containing the substring "registry" (quoted or angle-bracket) is
         flagged by name on sight, whether or not it resolves to a real
         local file — this is not a superset/subset of check 1 in either
         direction; each catches cases the other does not.
  * A literal task-string comparison in several spellings (`task ==`,
    `.task_name() ==`, `switch (getTask())`, `task.compare(...)`, etc).
  * An engine file reaching outside its allowed dependency surface (see
    ENGINE_INCLUDE_ALLOWLIST / ENGINE_INCLUDE_PREFIXES / INCLUDE_ROOTS).

What this guard CANNOT CATCH (an honest limit, not an oversight):
  * A task decision routed through an indirect helper, e.g.
    `SomeTaskHelper(info) == kYoloFamily` or a macro/constexpr table that
    encodes the same branch without the literal word "task" or a string
    literal anywhere nearby. Recognizing that requires understanding what a
    helper function *does*, not just what it is *named* — that needs a real
    C++ semantic parse (a compiler front end), which is out of scope for a
    dependency-free regex script. **This class of violation is the task
    review's responsibility, not this guard's** — a human (or a reviewing
    agent) reading a new helper function's body is what catches "this is a
    task switch wearing a trenchcoat".
  * Anything hidden behind conditional compilation (#ifdef) that changes
    meaning per build, since this guard reads one text form of the file.
This guard is a tripwire that raises the cost of adding a violation. It is
not a proof that none exists.

Self-tested (see task-5-report.md) across four review-and-fix rounds after
this guard's first draft: a concrete registry named outside the two literal
names in that first draft; a concrete registry pulled in only via
#include; three different spellings of a task-string switch; an unreadable
(non-UTF-8) file; an empty/missing common/graph/ directory (first draft). A
registry class named `Zoo` with no "registry" anywhere in its name or
filename, included from a file outside ENGINE_INCLUDE_ALLOWLIST, both as a
bare `"zoo.hpp"` and as a full `"common/graph/zoo.hpp"` sibling path (fix
round 1). The SAME `Zoo` evasion again spelled with `<>` instead of `""` —
the hole round 1 actually left open, since round 1 still branched on the
quote character — plus `registry_utils.hpp` (round 1's own regression,
restored), a genuine system header, a genuine OpenCV header, a genuine
dxrt header, and a legitimate allowlisted engine header, each tried BOTH
quoted and angle-bracket (fix round 2). A phantom include — an
internal-shaped path (`common/graph/zoo_config.hpp`) that does not exist
on disk at scan time, e.g. produced by a codegen build step — in both
quote forms; a phantom that IS genuinely external (`some_vendor/thing.hpp`)
in both quote forms, which must stay clean; a real allowlisted header,
which must also stay clean; and the INCLUDE_ROOTS drift tripwire itself,
fired by removing one of its expected substrings from a copy of
CMakeLists.txt, then cleared by restoring it, then fired again by removing
CMakeLists.txt entirely (fix round 3). A BARE-relative phantom include
(`#include "zoo_config.hpp"` / `#include <zoo_config2.hpp>`, no
"common/"-shaped prefix at all, file not on disk — the round-3 fix's own
gap) in both quote forms; a phantom rooted for a non-"common/" name; a
genuine stdlib header (both `<vector>` and `"vector"` forms, plus the
`<c*>`/`*.h` C-compatibility forms), a genuine `opencv2/` header and a
genuine `dxrt/` header, all confirmed clean; an unresolvable header NOT in
KNOWN_EXTERNAL (`<boost/optional.hpp>`), confirmed flagged; the drift
tripwire's scoping itself, reproduced exactly as a reviewer did against a
copy of the real production CMakeLists.txt — removing `${PROJECT_ROOT}/
src/utility/` from only the two graph-relevant target blocks while leaving
it in the top-level `include_directories()`, `dxapp_common_obj`'s own
block, and the source list — now correctly fires FATAL instead of passing
clean; and a target block deleted from CMakeLists.txt entirely, which also
correctly fires FATAL rather than assuming the transcription is still fine
(fix round 4). All violations fail loudly; none pass silently, and nothing
legitimate was ever rejected.

# An engine file under common/graph/ (i.e. every file this guard checks —
# see discover_files()) may #include only:
#   (a) another header that is a direct sibling of i_registry.hpp inside
#       common/graph/ itself — ENGINE_INCLUDE_ALLOWLIST is that explicit,
#       exact set of filenames. It is a literal list on purpose: adding a
#       legitimate new engine header (graph_config.hpp, graph_runner_sync.hpp,
#       roi_router.hpp, graph_visualizer.hpp, stage_graph.hpp, ...) is meant
#       to be a deliberate one-line addition to THIS list as part of that
#       task's own diff, not something that passes for free because it
#       happens to live in the right directory. A file placed directly under
#       common/graph/ that is NOT on this list — or a file placed anywhere
#       under common/graph/test/ other than by the exempted test/ directory
#       rule below — fails, regardless of what its class is named. This is
#       the check that catches a concrete registry renamed to something with
#       no "registry" in its name or filename at all (e.g. a class `Zoo` in
#       `zoo.hpp`): `zoo.hpp` is simply not on this list.
#   (b) a header under one of ENGINE_INCLUDE_PREFIXES — the framework the
#       engine is allowed to consume (base result structs, processors,
#       trackers, inputs, visualizers).
#   (c) a genuinely EXTERNAL header (standard library, OpenCV, dxrt) — see
#       _resolve_include() below. This is decided by asking the filesystem
#       whether the include resolves to a real file inside this repository,
#       via every -I root src/cpp_example/CMakeLists.txt actually wires up
#       for a common/graph/ translation unit. It is NOT decided by the
#       quote character. Round-1 of this guard branched on `<` vs `"` and
#       treated every angle-bracket include as external; that was wrong —
#       src/cpp_example/ is on this project's plain -I path (not -isystem),
#       so `#include <common/graph/zoo.hpp>` resolves and COMPILES exactly
#       like the quoted form (confirmed: CMakeLists.txt:130-137, target_
#       include_directories(... PRIVATE ${CPP_EXAMPLE_DIR} ...) with no
#       SYSTEM keyword). A reviewer reproduced the round-1 evasion end to
#       end with that one-character change and got a clean pass. Branching
#       on the quote character answers a question the compiler does not
#       ask; resolving the path is the question the compiler actually asks,
#       so that is what this guard asks too.
# Anything else — a bare relative include, a path under common/graph/test/,
# a path outside common/ entirely, a concrete registry pulled in from
# somewhere else — is a violation, independent of the name-based checks
# above and independent of what class the included file defines.

# M2 ruling: the tripwire must search only the CMakeLists.txt blocks it
# claims to verify, not the whole file. src/cpp_example/CMakeLists.txt
# repeats several of the _INCLUDE_ROOT_SPECS substrings in unrelated
# places — a top-level include_directories() call, dxapp_common_obj's own
# target_include_directories() block, and the postprocess source list —
# so a whole-file grep stays green even when the graph-relevant target
# blocks themselves lose a root (a realistic accidental CMakeLists.txt
# refactor, not a contrived attack). The two graph-relevant call sites are
# these targets' own target_include_directories() blocks:
GRAPH_CMAKE_TARGETS = ("dxapp_graph_obj", "graph_engine_test")
# Both blocks reach their postprocess roots only through this variable, not
# by writing the literal path inline (see CMakeLists.txt lines 130-137 and
# 146-153, both of which end in "${DXAPP_POSTPROCESS_INCLUDES}") — so the
# postprocess entries in _INCLUDE_ROOT_SPECS are truly and singularly
# defined here, and this is the third block in scope alongside the two
# targets above, not a loosening of the M2 scoping: it is still not the
# top-level include_directories(), not dxapp_common_obj's own block, and
# not the source list — the three places the reviewer's reproduction left
# the substring in on purpose to prove the whole-file grep was too loose.
