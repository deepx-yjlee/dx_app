"""Does a PASS actually draw anything?

scripts/sweep_npu_inference.py answers "did it run": it requires the runner's inference
line, so a script exiting 0 without touching the NPU is NO_INFERENCE rather than PASS.
It does NOT answer "was there a result" -- a postprocessor returning an empty list on
every frame passes that bar cleanly, and so does a visualizer that draws nothing.

This closes that gap the cheapest honest way: run one model per task with --save and
compare the rendered output against the input image. Identical pixels mean nothing was
drawn. A different size means the app produced a new image entirely (a depth map, a
super-resolved frame, a side-by-side), which also counts as having produced something.

One representative per task, chosen as the alphabetically first PASS in that task, so
the sample is not cherry-picked.

The three embedding tasks (face_recognition, the eigenplaces models dx-modelzoo files
under super_resolution, and zero_shot_image_classification) are reported SKIP here:
their input is a directory of image pairs and their output is a vector, not a picture.
Verify those with the embedding check in the same session -- a finite, unit-norm,
image-dependent vector -- rather than by looking for pixels.
