"""The 147 DX Model Zoo additions that dx-modelzoo has not published yet.

This module is DATA. It is the single source for every generated artifact:
``config/model_registry.json`` entries, ``tests/data/processor_specs.json`` entries,
the ``provisional`` section of ``tests/data/modelzoo_cv_tree.json`` and the
``scripts/modelzoo_manifest.json`` rows. Change a family name here and re-run
``scripts/add_modelzoo_2_5_0_models.py`` -- never edit the generated files.

Why "provisional": dx-modelzoo assigns ``(task, family)`` as DATA, and for these 147
that data does not exist yet (harvested 2026-09-22: 350 variants, zero overlap with
this list). The names below follow dx-modelzoo's own rule, read from the repo: the
family boundary is the POSTPROCESSING CHAIN.

    yolov8-s_640x640         family yolov8     postprocessing: yolov8_decode, nms
    yolov8-s_640x640_decode  family yolov8     postprocessing: yolov8_decode, nms
    yolov8-n_640x640_ppu     family yolo-ppu   postprocessing: ppu_nms

A different *compiled output* of the same architecture with the same postprocessing
stays in the architecture family (``_decode``); a different *postprocessing mechanism*
gets its own family, even though ``yolov8-n_640x640_ppu`` shares weights with
``yolov8-n_640x640`` (``yolo-ppu`` holds v3/v4/v5/v7/v8/v9/v10/11/v12/x side by side).
Pre-optimized models carry a wholly different chain -- a top-k row table, no dense
decode, no standard NMS -- so they get mechanism families: ``yolo_preopt`` and
``yolo_preopt_pose``. A ``_pre-optimized`` filename alone does NOT put a model there:
only the ten stems MEASURED to emit the table (yolo26 det and pose) belong to them, and
every other ``_pre-optimized`` stem emits its plain sibling's tensor and stays in its
architecture family. There is no ``yolo_preopt_seg`` -- see the note where it would be.

dx_app renders dx-modelzoo's ``-`` as ``_`` in directory and registry ``family``
values, as it already does for ``yolo-ppu`` -> ``yolo_ppu`` and ``stdc-seg`` ->
``stdc_seg``.

# whose MIDDLE token is the channel count, e.g. 1280x3x736 --
# retinaface_mobilenetv1_736x1280 pins that reading: registry w=1280 h=736).
#
# The .dxnn stem's own axis order is NOT consistent -- it inherits whatever the
# upstream repo called it (PaddleSeg's pp-liteseg 960x720 is WxH, MMSeg's
# stdc1-seg50 512x1024 is HxW) -- so the normalised column is the source, not the stem.

    # dark_hrnet_w32_256x192 says 192x256x3, and both are MMPose top-down person crops,
    # so the dark-hrnet row looked like the typo.
    #
    # The model says otherwise. With DX-RT 3.5.0 able to load it, its input tensor is
    # [1, 192, 256, 3] (NHWC) -- H=192, W=256, landscape -- and its heatmap is
    # (1, 17, 48, 64), which at stride 4 means exactly that. The zoo row was right and
    # the reasoning from convention was wrong. Left as a comment because "the table
    # looks transposed" is a tempting argument to make again.
    # Not an image. The .dxnn takes [1, 77, 512] CLIP token embeddings, and
