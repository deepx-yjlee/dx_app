# Project README

## Overview  

**DX-APP** is a production-ready suite of application templates designed to accelerate the development of AI services on **DEEPX NPUs**. It bridges the gap between raw model deployment and high-performance application engineering.  

**Key Features & Objectives**  

- **Rapid Deployment:** Ready-to-run examples across multiple AI task categories — Classification, Object Detection, Face Detection, Pose Estimation, Semantic/Instance Segmentation, Depth Estimation, OBB Detection, Embedding, and more.
-	**Dual-Language Flexibility:** High-performance **C++** for production and **Python** for rapid prototyping, each with their own shared runtime layer (`src/cpp_example/common/` for C++, `src/python_example/common/` for Python).  
- **Hardware Acceleration:** Native support for **PPU-enabled models** and **Async templates** that overlap pipeline stages to maximize FPS.  
- **Modular Design:** Clean, task-oriented templates that serve as reusable blueprints for custom commercial applications.

## Quick Start Guide

Follow these steps to transition from a fresh installation to your first successful inference on DEEPX NPU.  

**Step 1. Environment Setup & Verification**  

First, verify that the NPU driver and DX-RT are correctly installed. This is a mandatory prerequisite.  

```bash
## Verify hardware connection and driver status
dxrt-cli -s
```

!!! warning "Caution: Prerequisite Check"  

      If the command above fails, you **must** manually install the NPU Drivers and DX-RT before continuing with DX-APP setup. Refer to the installation and build documentation under `docs/source/docs/`.  

Once hardware is verified, install the necessary toolchain and system libraries.  

```bash
## Install Build tools, CMake, and OpenCV
./install.sh --all
```

**Step 2. Asset Acquisition**  

Download the required models and sample media files.  

```bash
## Interactive mode (default) — select categories and models from a menu
./setup.sh

## Non-interactive — download all models automatically without prompts
./setup.sh --all

## Preview what would be downloaded (no actual download)
./setup.sh --dry-run

## Download only a specific category
./setup.sh --category=object_detection

## Download specific models by name
./setup.sh --models yolov8n yolov9s efficientnet_lite0

## Internal/air-gapped — copy from local mount instead of downloading from S3
./setup.sh --all --internal

## Internal mode with a custom local path
./setup.sh --all --internal --internal-path=/path/to/local/models
```

**`setup.sh` Options**  

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--all` | Download all models non-interactively |
| `--dry-run` | List models that would be downloaded without downloading |
| `--list` | List available models without downloading |
| `--workers=<N>` | Parallel download threads (default: 4) |
| `--category=<name>` | Download models of a specific category only |
| `--models <m1> [m2...]` | Download specific models by name |
| `--no-json` | Skip JSON metadata file downloads |
| `--manifest=<path>` | Use an alternate manifest JSON file |
| `--force` | Force overwrite if files already exist (default) |
| `--no-force` | Skip download if the file already exists |
| `--force-remove-models` | Force remove models if they exist |
| `--force-remove-videos` | Force remove videos if they exist |
| `--verbose` | Enable verbose logging |

- **Models:** Saved to `assets/models/`. By default, an interactive menu lets you select which model categories and models to download. Use `--all` to skip the menu and download everything automatically.
- **Media:** Saved to `assets/videos/`.

For most users, `./setup.sh` is the only required entry point for asset preparation.  

If you are maintaining examples rather than only consuming them, review [DX Tool Guide](10_DX-APP_DX-Tool_Guide.md).  

**Step 3. Build & Execution**  

Build the C++ binaries and the Python dx_postprocess bindings simultaneously.  

```bash
## Default build (minimal — builds run_demo C++ targets and installs dx_postprocess)
./build.sh

## Full build (all C++ targets + install)
./build.sh --all

## For a clean rebuild, use: ./build.sh --clean

## Build specific targets only (faster incremental builds)
./build.sh --target yolov9s_sync yolov9s_async

## List all available build targets
./build.sh --target list
```

- **Output:** Binaries are located in `bin/`, and shared libraries are in their respective build folders.  


Test the NPU performance using the YOLOv9 object detection template.  

**C++ Implementation (High Performance)**  

```bash
## Static Image Inference (Synchronous)
./bin/yolov9s_sync \
-m assets/models/yolov9-s_640x640.dxnn \
-i sample/img/sample_kitchen.jpg

## Video Stream Inference (Asynchronous)
./bin/yolov9s_async \
-m assets/models/yolov9-s_640x640.dxnn \
-v assets/videos/dance-group.mov
```

**Python Implementation (Rapid Prototyping)**  

```bash
## Python Baseline (Synchronous)
python src/python_example/object_detection/yolov9s/yolov9s_sync.py \
   --model assets/models/yolov9-s_640x640.dxnn \
   --image sample/img/sample_kitchen.jpg

## Python Optimized (Asynchronous + C++ Post-processing)
python src/python_example/object_detection/yolov9s/yolov9s_async_cpp_postprocess.py \
  --model assets/models/yolov9-s_640x640.dxnn \
    --video assets/videos/dance-group.mov 
```

**Output and Analysis**  

Following execution, a window will render results (`boxes/masks`), and the console will output a **Performance Summary** (`Latency/FPS`). For additional usage details, refer to [DX-APP C++ Usage Guide](03_DX-APP_CPP_Example_Usage_Guide.md) and [DX-APP Python Usage Guide](05_DX-APP_Python_Example_Usage_Guide.md).

## Prerequisites

Before building the templates, ensure your system meets the following hardware and software requirements.  

**A. DEEPX Runtime (DX-RT) and NPU Drivers**  

To utilize NPU acceleration, you **must** install the kernel-mode drivers and the user-space runtime library  

- **DEEPX NPU Linux Driver:** Required for low-level NPU communication. [Github Repository](https://github.com/DEEPX-AI/dx_rt_npu_linux_driver)  
- **DX-RT (Runtime & Tools):** The core library for model inference and hardware management. [Github Repository](https://github.com/DEEPX-AI/dx_rt)  

**B. Development Toolchain and Libraries**  

The following tools are required to compile the C++ templates and the Python dx_postprocess bindings.  

**B-a.** Build System  

- **CMake:** Version 3.14 or higher.  
- **Compiler:** C++14-compatible (GCC 7.5+, Clang, etc.).  
- **Build Utility:** make or ninja.  

**B-b.** Core Libraries  

- **OpenCV:** Version 4.2.0 or higher (**4.5.5 recommended**). This is used for image I/O and pre/post-processing visualization.  
- **Python Environment:** Python 3.8 or higher and pip are required for Python-based examples and pybind11 integration.  

### Development Workflow Overview  

The process from environment setup to running your first AI application is divided into three main phases. For detailed commands and execution steps, please refer to the [**Section. Quick Start Guide**](#quick-start-guide).  

- **Hardware & Driver Verification:** Ensure the NPU is recognized by the system using the `dxrt-cli` tool.  
- **Asset & Dependency Preparation:** Install required libraries (OpenCV, Build tools) via `./install.sh` and prepare models/videos via `./setup.sh`. Model assets are fetched through the current [DX-ModelZoo](https://developer.deepx.ai/modelzoo/)-based setup flow.  
- **Build & Execution:** Compile the source code using `./build.sh` and run the generated binaries or Python scripts located in the `bin/` or `src/python_example/` directories.  

For contributor workflows such as model onboarding, validation, filtered execution, and benchmarking, refer to [DX Tool Guide](10_DX-APP_DX-Tool_Guide.md).

!!! note "User vs Contributor Guidance"  

      This README is primarily a user-facing overview. If you are extending examples, onboarding new models, or maintaining the repository structure, use the contributor-oriented documents linked from this page.  

### Pipeline Architecture

**C++ Application Templates** (`src/cpp_example/`)  

These templates provide high-performance, production-ready references for building applications using the DX-RT C++ API.  

The refactored C++ tree is organized by **task → model family → variant**, with a shared `common/` layer providing base interfaces, shared processors, task-specific runner pairs, visualizers, and input abstraction. Each model directory delegates to `common/` via the factory pattern. For details, refer to [DX-APP C++ Usage Guide](03_DX-APP_CPP_Example_Usage_Guide.md) and [DX-APP Example Source Structure](11_DX-APP_Example_Source_Structure.md).

**Pipeline Architecture**  

Each template follows a self-contained pipeline designed for modularity  

- **Step 1. Input:** Image, Video, Camera, or RTSP stream (via `common/inputs/`).  
- **Step 2. Pre-process:** Resizing and normalization (via `common/utility/`).  
- **Step 3. Inference:** Execution on the NPU via **DX-RT**.  
- **Step 4. Post-process:** Call to shared C++ processors in `common/processors/` (e.g., NMS, box scaling).  
- **Step 5. Output:** Result rendering via `common/visualizers/` (Display) or storage (Save).  

### Post-processing Libraries (`src/postprocess/`)

These libraries transform raw NPU output tensors into structured, actionable data. They are **consumed by the pybind11 bindings** (`src/bindings/python/dx_postprocess/`) to enable `*_cpp_postprocess.py` variants in Python.  

!!! note "NOTE"  

    The C++ examples under `src/cpp_example/` do **not** use `src/postprocess/` directly. They have their own shared processors in `src/cpp_example/common/processors/`. The `src/postprocess/` library exists specifically for the pybind11 bridge.  

**Module Structure**  

The library is organized into model-specific subdirectories (e.g., `yolov5/, yolov8/, deeplabv3/`), each containing  

- `*_postprocess.h`: Defines the post-processing class (e.g., `YOLOv5PostProcess`) and standard result structures (e.g., `YOLOv5Result`).  
- `*_postprocess.cpp`: Contains the optimized implementation for decoding, coordinate scaling, and filtering.  
- `CMakeLists.txt`: Facilitates the compilation of these modules into reusable shared libraries.  

**Functional Responsibilities**  

The libraries handle the heavy computational load required after the inference stage  

- **Tensor Decoding:** Converting raw NPU buffer outputs into human-readable results such as bounding boxes, confidence scores, and class IDs.  
- **Advanced Geometry:** Extracting keypoints for pose estimation or skeletons.  
- **Mask Generation:** Processing multi-dimensional tensors into segmentation masks.  
- **Filtering & Optimization:** Applying algorithms like **Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)** and threshold-based filtering to remove redundant detections.  

**Cross-Language Integration**  

- **For Python Developers:** The `*_cpp_postprocess.py` variants use these C++ libraries via the `dx_postprocess` pybind11 module, achieving near-native performance.  
- **For C++ Developers:** The C++ examples use their own shared processors in `src/cpp_example/common/processors/`, which are compiled and linked directly.

## Usage Reference

### CLI Reference

All C++ and Python examples share a consistent set of command-line arguments.

**Common Arguments**  

| Flag | C++ | Python | Description |
|------|-----|--------|-------------|
| `-m` / `--model` | `-m` | `--model` | Path to `.dxnn` model file (auto-downloaded if missing) |
| `-i` / `--image` | `-i` | `--image` | Input image file or directory |
| `-v` / `--video` | `-v` | `--video` | Input video file |
| `-c` / `--camera` | `-c` | `--camera` | Camera device index |
| `-r` / `--rtsp` | `-r` | `--rtsp` | RTSP stream URL |
| `-l` / `--loop` | `-l` (default: auto) | `--loop` (default: 1) | Inference repeat count |
| `--no-display` | `--no-display` | `--no-display` | Disable visualization window |
| `-s` / `--save` | `--save` | `--save` | Save rendered output to run directory |
| `--save-dir` | `--save-dir` | `--save-dir` | Base output directory (default: `artifacts/`) |
| `--dump-tensors` | `--dump-tensors` | `--dump-tensors` | Dump raw input/output tensors to files |
| `--config` | `--config` | `--config` | Model config JSON path (auto-detected if omitted) |
| `-h` / `--help` | `-h` | `-h` | Show usage |

- **Input Source Rule:** `--image`, `--video`, `--camera`, and `--rtsp` form a mutually exclusive group. If none is specified, a **default sample image** is automatically selected based on the task type.

**Environment Variables**  

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `DXAPP_SAVE_IMAGE` | When set to a file path, saves the visualization output to that path (no `--save` required) |
| `DXAPP_VERIFY` | When set to `1`, dumps post-processing results to `logs/verify/{model}.json` for numerical verification |

### C++ Templates 

To help developers optimize for specific hardware targets, templates are provided in two execution patterns  

- **Synchronous (`xx_sync.cpp`):

    : **Logic:** A single-threaded, sequential loop (**Input → Inference → Output**).  
    : **Use Case:** Best for single-image processing and simplified debugging.  

- **Asynchronous (`xx_async.cpp`):

    : **Logic:** Uses multi-threading and the `RunAsync()` API to overlap stages. While the NPU performs inference on Frame **N**, the CPU simultaneously handles pre-processing for Frame **N+1** and post-processing for Frame **N-1**.  
    : **Use Case:** Essential for maximizing **FPS** on live video streams and ensuring high NPU utilization.  

### Python Integration (Bindings & Examples)  

DX-APP provides a unified environment that combines the rapid development of Python with the high performance of native C++.  

**High-Performance C++ Bindings** (`dx_postprocess`)  

To eliminate post-inference bottlenecks, DX-APP provides optimized C++ logic exposed via `pybind11`.  

- **Key Capabilities:** Handles CPU-intensive tasks such as NMS (Non-Maximum Suppression), tensor decoding, and mask generation at native speeds.  
- **Unified Logic:** Shares the exact same decoding logic as the C++ examples, ensuring consistent inference results across all platforms.  
- **Installation:** -Automatically compiled during `./build.sh`.  
    : **Manual install:** `cd src/bindings/python/dx_postprocess && pip install`.  

For detailed usage examples and API references, please refer to the documentation in 
[**Section. DX-APP Python Post-processing**](08_DX-APP_Pybind_PostProcess_Overview.md)

**Application Examples** (`src/python_example/`)  

These templates utilize `dx_engine` (for inference) and `dx_postprocess` (for acceleration). Users can choose from four variants depending on their performance requirements.  

The refactored Python tree is organized by **task → model family → variant**, with a shared `common/` layer providing base interfaces, shared processors, generic sync/async runners, visualizers, and input abstraction — the same factory-based architecture as the C++ side. For structure and contributor-facing rules, refer to [DX-APP Python Usage Guide](05_DX-APP_Python_Example_Usage_Guide.md) and [DX-APP Example Source Structure](11_DX-APP_Example_Source_Structure.md).  

**Task-Based Structure**    

Templates are categorized by task across multiple task directories. All examples share the `common/` runtime layer for processors, runners, and visualizers. Representative tasks:  

- **Classification:** EfficientNet, AlexNet, ResNet, MobileNet, etc.  
- **Object Detection:** YOLOv5/v7/v8/v9/v10/v11/v12, YOLOX, NanoDet, DAMOYOLO, SSD  
- **Face Detection:** SCRFD, YOLOv5Face, YOLOv7Face, RetinaFace  
- **Pose Estimation:** YOLOv8-Pose  
- **Segmentation:** BiSeNet, DeepLabV3+, SegFormer, YOLOv8Seg  
- **Depth, Embedding, OBB, Denoising, Enhancement, Super Resolution, Hand Landmark, Attribute Recognition, Re-ID, PPU**  

**Functional Variants**  

| **Variant** | **Post-processing** | **Threading Model** | **Recommendation** | 
|----|----|----|----|
| `*_sync.py` | Pure Python | Synchronous | Learning & Logic Debugging | 
| `*_async.py` | Pure Python | Asynchronous | Basic performance optimization | 
| `*_sync_cpp_postprocess.py` | C++ Binding | Synchronous | Accelerating heavy CPU tasks | 
| `*_async_cpp_postprocess.py` | C++ Binding | Asynchronous | Maximum FPS (Recommended) |

## Advanced Features

DX-APP includes several production-oriented features built into all templates.


**Auto-Download**

When running any example (C++ or Python), if the specified model file is not found locally, the runner automatically attempts to download it via `setup_sample_models.sh`. Similarly, if a `--video` file is missing, `setup_sample_videos.sh` is invoked automatically. If the download fails, a clear error message with manual download instructions is displayed.

**Default Input Fallback**

If no input source (`--image`, `--video`, `--camera`, `--rtsp`) is provided, the runner automatically selects a **default sample image** appropriate for the task type. A log message indicates which default was applied.

**Signal Handling**  

All runners register SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers for graceful shutdown. Pressing Ctrl+C during inference prints `"Interrupted by user"` and cleanly exits, releasing all resources.  

**Run Directory** (`--save` / `--save-dir`)  

When `--save` is enabled, a timestamped run directory is created:  

```text
artifacts/cpp_example/
  {model}_sync-image-{name}-{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}/
    run_info.txt        # Metadata (script, model, input paths)
    output.jpg          # Saved visualization (image mode)
    output.mp4          # Saved visualization (video mode)
    dump_tensors/       # (if --dump-tensors) raw tensor files
```

**Numerical Verification** (`DXAPP_VERIFY`)  

A complete pipeline for serializing inference results for inspection and debugging:  

- (1) Set `DXAPP_VERIFY=1` before running any example  
- (2) Post-processing results are serialized to `logs/verify/{model}.json`  
- (3) Supports all 12 result types (Detection, Classification, Pose, Segmentation, etc.)  

**Tensor Dump** (`--dump-tensors`)  

Dumps raw input/output tensors for debugging. On exception, tensors are auto-dumped with a `reason.txt` file. C++ outputs `.bin` files; Python outputs `.npy` files.  

**Model Config** (`--config`)  

Runtime parameters (score threshold, NMS threshold, top-k) live in `<task>/<family>/<variant>/config.json`. A Python family entry selects that folder with `--variant`. A C++ family entry takes the variant from the `.dxnn` stem. A single-model extract may keep `config.json` beside the entry script.  

**Version Compatibility**  

All runners verify:  

- **DX-RT library** ≥ 3.0.0  
- **Compiled model format** ≥ v7  

Incompatible versions produce a clear error message before exit.

**Headless Mode**  

Python runners detect the absence of `DISPLAY`/`WAYLAND_DISPLAY` and skip `cv2.imshow()` automatically. Use `--no-display` for explicit headless operation in both C++ and Python.
