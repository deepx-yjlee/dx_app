## Installation on Linux

This section describes the software requirements and installation steps for setting up **DX-APP** on Ubuntu-based and Debian-based systems.  

### Software Requirements on Linux  

To run **DX-APP** on Linux, the following components **must** be installed.  

- **OS**: Ubuntu 18.04 / 20.04 / 22.04 / 24.04 (x64) and Debian 12 / 13 (x64)  
- **DEEPX M1 Runtime Lib Version**: v3.0.0 or higher  

All required components are included in the **DXNN All Suite (DX-AS)** package.  


### Prerequisites Setup

**Step 1. Install DX-RT Device Driver**  

To set up the build Environment, refer to **Section. Linux Device Driver Installation** in **DX-RT User Manual**.  

Once the DX-RT device driver is installed, the system should include both the PCIe driver and the runtime driver.  You can verify the installation by checking the loaded kernel modules.  

```bash
lsmod | grep dx

# dxrt_driver 53248 2
# dx_dma 475136 7 dxrt_driver
```

**Step 2. Install DX-RT Library**   

To install the DX-RT library and NPU device driver, refer to **Section. Build Guide for Cross-compile** in **DX-RT User Manual**.  

Once **DX-RT** is built, the runtime library and header files are installed in the following directory.  

- Libraries: `/usr/local/lib`  
- Headers: `/usr/local/include`  

```cmake
set(DXRT_INSTALLED_DIR /usr/local)
```

If necessary, you can modify the installation path by editing `cmake/toolchain.x86_64.cmake`.  


### DX-APP Application Setup  

**Step 1. DX-APP Installation Options**  

You can check the available **DX-APP** installation options by running the following command.  

```bash
./install.sh # --help
```

You can view more installation options by entering the `--help` flag.  

**Step 2. OpenCV Installation Options**  

If you want to enable CPU/GPU acceleration, OpenCV **must** be manually installed on your system.  
During the OpenCV build process, setting the following flags is needed.  

- `TBB=ON, IPP=ON, CUDA=ON`  

If OpenCV is already installed, manually set the `OpenCV_DIR` path in your toolchain file.  

```cmake
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Linux)
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR x86_64)
set(DXRT_INSTALLED_DIR /usr/local)
set(OpenCV_DIR /your/opencv/installation/dir)
set(onnxruntime_LIB_DIRS /usr/local/lib)
```

**Step 3. Build and Run DX-APP**  

To build `dx_app`, run the following command.  

```bash
./build.sh ## Defaults to minimal build (run_demo C++ targets). Use --clean for a clean build.
```

To download required models and sample videos, run the following command.  

```bash
./setup.sh
```

Assets are downloaded and placed in the `assets/` directory.

- **Models:** stored under `assets/models/`
- **Videos:** stored under `assets/videos/`

!!! note "NOTE"
    Running `setup.sh` beforehand is optional. When you run any individual example, missing models are **automatically downloaded** on demand. Videos are also auto-downloaded when a `--video` path is specified but the file does not exist.

!!! note "NOTE"
    The sample models (`.dxnn`) and dataset images are provided for **evaluation and development purposes only** and are not licensed for commercial deployment. For full license details, see [Appendix: Third-Party License Notice](./Appendix_Third_Party_License.md).

**`setup.sh` Options**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--all` | Download all models non-interactively |
| `--dry-run` | List models that would be downloaded without downloading |
| `--list` | List available models without downloading |
| `--workers=<N>` | Parallel download threads (default: 4) |
| `--category=<name>` | Download models of a specific category only |
| `--models <m1> [m2...]` | Download specific models by name |
| `--no-json` | Skip JSON metadata file downloads |
| `--manifest=<path>` | Use an alternate manifest JSON file |
| `--force` | Force overwrite if files already exist (default) |
| `--no-force` | Skip download if the file already exists |
| `--force-remove-models` | Force remove models if they exist |
| `--force-remove-videos` | Force remove videos if they exist |
| `--verbose` | Show detailed progress output |

In internal-network environments, the setup flow can use the internal [DX-ModelZoo](https://developer.deepx.ai/modelzoo/) source automatically when the intranet mode is enabled by the surrounding environment.

For most users, running only `./setup.sh` is sufficient. Contributor-facing setup details are documented separately in the developer guides.

!!! note "Internal-Network Setup"
    In internal environments, DX-APP can use the internal DX-ModelZoo source to prepare model assets without requiring manual model-by-model input during the standard setup flow.

**Post-Processing Unit (PPU) Acceleration Integration**  

DX-APP utilizes PPU Acceleration to maximize inference efficiency on NPU hardware.  

The PPU is engineered to offload computationally intensive post-processing tasks, specifically bounding box decoding and score thresholding, directly to the NPU. This critical architectural shift mitigates the CPU overhead traditionally incurred during post-processing, leading to a substantial enhancement in overall inference throughput.  

**Key Operational Benefits**  

- **Improved Processing Speed:** Achieved by enabling the parallel execution of both the core inference and the post-processing operations.  
- **Enhanced Throughput:** Provides a significant advantage for real-time applications that require sustained high frame rates.  

**PPU-Enabled Models**  

DX-APP includes 11 PPU-accelerated model variants across multiple tasks. To run PPU models interactively, use `./run_demo.sh` and select "PPU Pipeline", or use the example runner / DX Model Tool:

```bash
# Interactive — select PPU from the category menu
scripts/run_examples.sh
./scripts/dx_tool.sh run

# Non-interactive
./scripts/dx_tool.sh run --lang cpp --category ppu
```

Available PPU models: YOLOv5S, YOLOv7, YOLOv7x, YOLOv8N, YOLOv8S, YOLOv9T, YOLOv10N, YOLOv11N, YOLOv12N, SCRFD500M, YOLOv5Pose.

**Step 4. Resolve Shared Library Errors**  

If you encounter shared library errors (e.g., `libdxrt.so`), update the system’s library cache. 

```bash
# Copy your library to /usr/local/lib
sudo cp your_library.so /usr/local/lib

# Update the system's library cache
sudo ldconfig
```

### Build and Install dx_app in Visual Studio Community 2022  

To build and run the `dx_app` application on Windows, follow the steps below using Visual Studio Community 2022.  

**Step 1. Open Project Folder**  

- **Step 1-1.** Launch Visual Studio Community 2022  
- **Step 1-2.** From the start screen, select **Open a local folder**  
- **Step 1-3.** Navigate to and select the `dx_app` project folder  

!!! warning "IMPORTANT" 

    You **must** use Visual Studio 2022. Support for other versions (VS 2019, VS Code, etc.) has not been tested and compatibility cannot be guaranteed.   

![](./../resources/02_05_Opening_dx_app.png)

**Step 2. Project Configuration**  

Upon opening the project,  

- Dependencies specified in `vcpkg.json` will be automatically downloaded and installed into the `vcpkg_installed` directory.  
- CMake will automatically generate the build cache and configuration.  

![](./../resources/02_06_CMake_Cache_Configuration.png)

**Step 3. (Optional) Edit CMakeSettings**  

If needed, you can manually specify the following environment variables in `CMakeSettings.json`.  

- `DEEPX_SDK_DIR`: Path to the installed DEEPX SDK (DX-RT runtime)  
- `OpenCV_DIR`: Path to the OpenCV installation (if manually installed)  

```json
{
    "name": "CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE",
    "value": "${env.VCPKG_ROOT}/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake",
    "type": "STRING"
},
{
    "name": "DEEPX_SDK_DIR",
    "value": "path/to/dx_rt/installed",
    "type": "STRING"
},
{
    "name": "OpenCV_DIR",
    "value": "${projectDir}/vcpkg_installed/x64-windows/share/opencv",
    "type": "STRING"
}
```

**Step 4. Register `PATH` Variable**  

Ensure the required runtime libraries are accessible with the system’s `PATH` environment variable.  

- `DEEPX_SDK_DIR` is referenced in CMAKE as `${env.DEEPX_SDK_DIR}`.  

!!! note "NOTE"  

    If you are using `dx_app/vcpkg.json`, OpenCV will be automatically downloaded and installed into `vcpkg_installed/x64-windows` directory during CMake configuration step.

**Step 5. Build and Install `dx_app`**  

To build and install the dx_app application  

- **Step 5-1.** Go to the **Build** menu  
- **Step 5-2.** Click **Build All** (or **Rebuild All**) to begin the build process  

Upon successful compilation, the application executable will be generated under the `bin/` directory.  

![](./../resources/02_08_Install_dxapp_to_install.png)


### Alternative Build Method: Using build.bat

The updated `build.bat` now generates `build_internal.bat` from `CMakeSettings.json` and drives both the DX-APP build and the pybind C++ module build.  

**Key behaviors**  

- Generates `build_internal.bat` based on the selected CMake configuration (toolchain, paths, generator).  
- Validates environment (e.g., `DEEPX_SDK_DIR`) and cleans stale CMake cache to avoid generator/toolset mismatches.  
- Builds and installs DX-APP executables/libraries, then builds the pybind C++ module.  

**Prerequisites**  

- `DEEPX_SDK_DIR` set to the DEEPX SDK installation directory  
- Visual Studio 2022 with Desktop development with C++ workload  
- CMake available in `PATH`  

**Usage**  

From the project root  
```batch
build.bat
```

`build_internal.bat` is written alongside, then executed to configure, build, and install outputs. Use the generated `dxapp.sln` (under the build directory, `./out/build/x64-Release/`) if you want to open in Visual Studio 2022 for further development.  

**Visual Studio solution Generation**  

After successful execution of build.bat, the script generates the necessary solution files for development within the IDE.  

- **[Important] Open Solution:** Open the generated solution file at `out\build\x64-Release\dxapp.sln`  **using Visual Studio 2022**  
     **NOTE.** Opening with other versions may cause compatibility issues or build failures.  
- **Access & Customization**: Use Visual Studio 2022 for debugging, development, and further customization. All project targets and configurations are accessible through the VS 2022 interface.  

**Build Output Structure**  

```text
dx_app/
├── out/                   # Build directory created by build.bat
│   ├── build/             # CMake build files
│   │   ├── x64-Release/   # Release build configuration
│   │   │   ├── dxapp.sln  # Visual Studio 2022 solution file
│   │   │   ├── *.vcxproj  # Project files for each target
│   │   │   └── ...        # Other build artifacts
│   │   └── ...
│   └── install/           # Installation directory
├── bin/                   # Installed executables
└── lib/                   # Installed libraries
```

### Run Example Executable Files On Windows  

After building and installing dx_app, you can execute the demo applications using provided batch scripts.  

**Step 1. Execute `setup.bat`**  

Run the `setup.bat` script to automatically download all required models and sample videos.  

- The downloaded assets will be placed in the `assets` folder.  
- The assets include models for Classification, Object Detection, and Segmentation.  

**Step 2. Run Examples**  

You can run the examples using the same command line instructions as in Linux, but using the `.exe` extension for executables.  

classification example  
```shell
./bin/efficientnet_lite0_async.exe -m ./assets/models/efficientnet-lite0_224x224.dxnn -i ./sample/ILSVRC2012/0.jpeg 
```

object detection example  
```shell
./bin/yolov8n_sync.exe  -m ./assets/models/yolov8-n_640x640.dxnn -i ./sample/img/sample_kitchen.jpg -l 10
```
