# DX-APP C++ Example Tests

## Overview

The project provides a comprehensive Python-based test suite located in `tests/cpp_example/`. These tests ensure that C++ binaries are functional, handle arguments correctly, produce correct visualizations, and meet performance benchmarks on the DEEPX NPU.

---

## Test Classification & Prerequisites

### Test Categories

The suite is organized into tiered categories based on execution speed and scope.

**CLI Tests (Fast)**  

- **Files**: `test_cli_help.py`, `test_cli_basic.py`  
- **Scope**: Validates `--help` options, `--version` flag, invalid argument handling, and no-argument behaviors for all executables.  

**E2E (End-to-End) Tests (Slow)**  

- **File**: `test_e2e.py`  
- **Scope**: Performs real inference on images and videos using `.dxnn` models to verify the full pipeline and NPU utilization.  
     : Auto-discovers all (executable, model) pairs from `bin/` and `assets/models/`.  
     : Assets: Uses real models from `assets/models/` and test data from `sample/img/` and `assets/videos/`.  
     : Parameters: Default loop count configurable via `--loop`.  
     : Timeouts: 100 seconds for image inference (300s for TTA models), 10 minutes for video inference.  

**Specialized Tests**  

Visualization Tests  

- **File**: `test_visualization.py`  
- **Scope**: Runs all sync + async binaries with `DXAPP_SAVE_IMAGE` and verifies image output is produced.  
     : Output directory: `tests/test_visualization_result/cpp_example/{sync,async}/<task>/`  
     : Can also be run standalone: `python test_visualization.py`  

Feature Tests  

| File | Marker | Scope |
|------|--------|-------|
| `test_save_mode.py` | `save_mode` | `--save` / `--save-dir` output and run directory creation |
| `test_dump_tensors.py` | `dump_tensors` | `--dump-tensors` tensor file generation |
| `test_verify.py` | `verify` | `DXAPP_VERIFY` JSON output validation |
| `test_multi_loop.py` | `multi_loop` | `-l N` loop count behavior |
| `test_signal_handling.py` | `signal_handling` | SIGINT graceful shutdown |

### Environment Setup

**Test Requirements**  
Before running tests, ensure the environment is prepared.

For CLI Tests  

- Executables must be built in the `bin/` directory.  
- Run `./build.sh` from the project root if executables are missing.  

For E2E Tests (Additional)  

- **Models**: Run `./setup_sample_models.sh` to populate `assets/models/`. The current setup flow uses the DX-ModelZoo downloader path and can prepare models non-interactively for internal-network environments.  
- **Test Data**: Ensure images exist in `sample/img/` and videos in `assets/videos/` (Run `./setup_sample_videos.sh`).  
- **Libraries**: Shared libraries must be present in the `lib/` directory.  

**Available Markers (`pytest.ini`)**  

`cli`, `help`, `e2e`, `visualization`, `async_exec`, `sync_exec`, `save_mode`, `dump_tensors`, `verify`, `multi_loop`, `signal_handling`

---

## Test Infrastructure

### Shared Module (`tests/test_helpers/`)

All test files import shared constants and utilities from `tests/test_helpers/`:  

- `constants.py`: `TASK_IMAGE_MAP`, `MODEL_IMAGE_OVERRIDE`, `MULTI_MODEL_EXECUTABLES`, path constants  
- `utils.py`: `setup_environment()`, `discover_cpp_executables()`, `normalize_model_name()`  

### Asset Management

Assets required for testing are automatically managed by scripts within the `scripts/` directory:  

- **Models**: Use `setup_sample_models.sh` to download lightweight, test-specific models.  
- **Videos**: Use `setup_sample_videos.sh` to acquire sample video files required for E2E (End-to-End) pipeline verification.

## Test Execution Guide

### Execution Methods

**Method A. Unified Test Runner (Recommended)**  

The `run_tc.sh` script provides a high-level interface for running standardized test suites directly from the project root.

```bash
cd ../../  # Go to project root (dx_app/)

# Run only C++ tests (CLI + E2E stream)
./run_tc.sh --cpp

# Run only C++ CLI tests (fast)
./run_tc.sh --cpp --cli

# Run only C++ E2E stream tests (all models)
./run_tc.sh --cpp --e2e

# Run only C++ E2E image tests (faster, skips stream)
./run_tc.sh --cpp --e2e-quick

# Run C++ tests with code coverage (standalone, for SonarQube)
./run_tc.sh --cpp --coverage

# Show all available options
./run_tc.sh --help
```

!!! note "TIP"
    Use `--e2e-quick` during development. It takes ~2–3 minutes, compared to 8–10 minutes for a full test.
    Use `--coverage` for SonarQube analysis — it cannot be combined with --cli, --e2e, etc.

**Method B. Manual Execution via Pytest**  

For granular control, run `pytest` directly from `tests/cpp_example/`.

Basic Usage  

```bash
# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run all tests (excluding slow E2E tests)
pytest -m "not e2e"

# Run only CLI tests (fast)
pytest test_cli_help.py test_cli_basic.py

# Run only E2E tests (slow, requires models and test data)
pytest test_e2e.py -v

# Run all tests including E2E with verbose output
pytest -v -s
```

Advanced Filtering  

```bash
cd tests/cpp_example

# Test specific model (all variants)
pytest -m e2e -k "yolov7"           # All yolov7 variants
pytest -m e2e -k "yolov7_async"     # Only yolov7_async

# Test multiple models
pytest -m e2e -k "yolov7 or yolov8"
pytest -m e2e -k "scrfd or yolov5"

# Exclude variants
pytest -m e2e -k "yolov7 and not async"  # Only yolov7 sync variants
pytest -m e2e -k "yolov5 and not ppu"    # yolov5 without ppu variants

# Combine with markers
pytest -m "e2e and async_exec" -k "yolov7"  # Only async yolov7 tests
pytest -m "e2e and sync_exec" -k "yolov5"   # Only sync yolov5 tests

# Run specific test function
pytest test_e2e.py::test_stream_inference_e2e[yolov7_async]
pytest test_e2e.py::test_image_inference_e2e[scrfd_async]

# Multiple specific tests
pytest test_e2e.py::test_stream_inference_e2e[yolov7_async] \
            test_e2e.py::test_stream_inference_e2e[yolov8_async]
```

### Result Analysis

**Performance Reporting**  

After running E2E tests, a performance report is automatically generated to provide deep insights into the inference pipeline efficiency.  

- **Console Output**: A formatted table with real-time FPS metrics.  
- **CSV File**: A detailed log saved as `performance_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv` in `tests/cpp_example/`.  

The report includes  

- **E2E FPS:** Overall pipeline throughput.  
- **Read FPS:** Speed of frame ingestion.  
- **Preprocess FPS:** Speed of image transformation (resizing, normalization).  
- **Inference FPS:** Pure NPU model execution speed.  
- **Postprocess FPS:** Speed of result parsing (NMS, coordinate scaling).  
- **Bottleneck Detection:** The slowest stage in the pipeline is automatically marked with an **asterisk (*)** for quick optimization targeting.  

**Test Coverage Summary**  

Example output: `./run_tc.sh --cpp --coverage`  

| **Category** | **Count** | **Status** |
|----|----|----|
| **CLI Tests** | ~1,293 | All binaries validated (help + basic) |
| **E2E Image Tests** | ~242 | sync + async, auto-discovered |
| **Visualization Tests** | ~247 | sync + async image verification |
| **Feature Tests** | ~22 | save_mode, dump_tensors, verify, multi_loop, signal_handling |

## Advanced Analysis: Code Coverage

Code coverage measures how much of the source code is exercised during testing. This is essential for ensuring the robustness of the NPU inference pipeline.

### Coverage Analysis Strategy

To generate code coverage reports, you need to build the project with instrumentation and install the following tools

- **Step 1.** Build executables with coverage instrumentation.  
- **Step 2.** Install coverage tools (`gcovr` is recommended; `lcov` is supported as a fallback).  

```bash
# Install gcovr (recommended - supports XML, HTML, JSON)
sudo apt-get install gcovr -y

# OR install lcov (HTML only)
sudo apt-get install lcov -y

# [Recommended] Build with debug mode for the most reliable coverage results
cd ../../  # Go to project root
./build.sh --clean --coverage --type debug

# [Alternative] Build with relwithdebinfo for faster builds (less accurate coverage)
./build.sh --clean --coverage --type relwithdebinfo

# Verify coverage build (check for .gcno files)
ls build_x86_64/src/examples/*.gcno
```

**Build & Environment**  

- `relwithdebinfo`: Recommended for development (1.5–2x slower, optimized with debug info)
- `debug`: Most detailed coverage (3–5x slower, no optimization, full symbol info)

```bash
# [Recommended] Build with debug mode for most reliable coverage
cd ../../  # Go to project root
./build.sh --clean --coverage --type debug

# [Alternative] Build with relwithdebinfo for faster turnaround
./build.sh --clean --coverage --type relwithdebinfo
```

### Report Generation

Trigger coverage analysis using the following commands

**Execution Flow** (Manual vs Unified)  

Manual Execution (from `tests/cpp_example/`)  

```bash
# Quick E2E with coverage (image tests only, 2-3 minutes)
pytest -m e2e -k "test_image_inference_e2e" --coverage -v

# Full E2E tests with coverage (8-10 minutes)
pytest -m e2e --coverage -v

# Run specific models with coverage
pytest -m e2e -k "yolov7" --coverage -v
```

Unified Test Runner (from project root)  

```bash
# [Recommended] Build with debug mode, then run coverage
./build.sh --clean --coverage --type debug && ./run_tc.sh --cpp --coverage

# Run C++ coverage (standalone)
./run_tc.sh --cpp --coverage
```

**Report Interpretation** (HTML Report & Filtering)  

After running tests with `--coverage`, several reports are generated in `tests/cpp_example/coverage/`

- **Console summary:** Line and branch coverage percentages.
- **HTML report:** Located at `html/index.html`. Shows line-by-line visualization with uncovered code in **red**.
- **XML (Cobertura) & JSON:** Timestamped for CI/CD integration.

View the HTML Report  

```bash
# Open in your browser
firefox tests/cpp_example/coverage/html/index.html
# or
xdg-open tests/cpp_example/coverage/html/index.html
```

Report Features  

- Overall and file-by-file coverage statistics.  
- Line-by-line visualization with **uncovered code highlighted in red**.  
- Branch coverage analysis.  

Coverage Filtering Rules  

- **Included:** All source files within the `src/` directory.  
- **Excluded:** System headers (`/usr/*\, third_party/*, extern/*`), and the `tests/` directory itself.

## Maintenance & CI/CD

### Continuous Integration (CI) Integration

**SonarQube Integration**  

XML reports generated via the `--coverage` flag are utilized by the CI server for static code analysis and test coverage tracking. This ensures long-term code quality and helps identify untested logic paths during the development lifecycle.  

**Nightly Build**  

A full suite of E2E tests is executed every night to perform regression testing. This process ensures that the application remains stable and functional despite frequent updates to NPU drivers, firmware, and the underlying runtime environment.
