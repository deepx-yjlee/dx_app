"""Variant resolution -- the one place that reads ``config/model_registry.json``.

A *variant* is identified by its ``.dxnn`` stem (e.g. ``yolov5-s_640x640``), which the
dx-modelzoo alignment made the registry's primary key. Resolution is therefore a plain
dict lookup: there is deliberately no normalisation, prefix matching or suffix
stripping here. The 4-pass fuzzy matcher this replaces existed only because example
directory names did not match their ``.dxnn`` -- with the family/variant layout they do,
and a typo must fail loudly instead of resolving to a neighbouring model.

Legacy example-directory names (``yolov5s``, ``deitbase384``) stay accepted as secondary
keys so scripts written against the old per-variant layout keep working.
