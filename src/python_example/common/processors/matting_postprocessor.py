"""PP-Matting postprocessor: a continuous alpha matte.

PaddleSeg's matting models emit one channel -- the foreground opacity of every pixel
-- rather than a class map. Neither ppmatting .dxnn is published (both URLs return
403), so this is written to that output shape and refuses anything else.

The result carries both forms on purpose:

``mask``  the alpha thresholded to a 0/1 class map. ``SemanticSegmentationVisualizer``
          reads ``mask`` as class IDs, so handing it a continuous alpha would render
          the matte through a 19-colour class palette.
``alpha`` the matte itself, in [0,1] at the original resolution, for anything that
          wants to composite with it rather than look at it.

A multi-class segmentation head is refused rather than sliced: taking channel 0 of a
19-class Cityscapes output would produce a believable image and be wrong.
