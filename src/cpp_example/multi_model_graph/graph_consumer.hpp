/**
 * @file graph_consumer.hpp
 * @brief What every consumer of the graph engine shares: one report schema,
 *        one path rule, one build sequence.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 * --------------------
 * The engine has two consumers: the multi_model_graph_{sync,async} CLI and
 * the dx_graph Python module (src/bindings/python/dx_graph/). They must
 * agree byte for byte on the JSON a FrameReport becomes, on where a
 * relative "uri" is looked up, on which checks run before a graph is built
 * and what those checks say when they fail. Two copies of that code would
 * drift, and the drift would only show as a Python result that no longer
 * matches the CLI's. So it lives here, once, moved out of graph_cli.cpp
 * unchanged, and both consumers call it.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT UNDER common/graph/
 * ---------------------------------
 * Same reason as graph_cli.hpp: this is consumer code. It includes the
 * concrete registry's neighbourhood (the input factory) and is linked
 * next to StaticModelRegistry, which
 * scripts/check_graph_boundary.py keeps out of every file under
 * common/graph/. Living here keeps that guard meaningful.

/**
 * @brief One frame's report.
 *
 * Deliberately carries nothing executor-specific - no timings, no
 * executor name - because tests/cpp_example/test_graph_cli.py compares the
 * sync binary's file with the async binary's byte for byte. Ordering is
 * already canonical: node_results and roi_results are std::maps (keyed by
 * node id) and each roi_results vector was stable_sorted by ByOrigin -
 * (parent_node, parent_index, roi_index) - by whichever executor produced
 * it.
 *
 * Non-finite numbers (U-11): nlohmann would write NaN, +Inf and -Inf all as
 * null. Every non-finite float in the tree is instead the STRING "NaN",
 * "Infinity" or "-Infinity" - valid JSON for strict parsers (JSON.parse,
 * jq, nlohmann::json::parse), distinct from each other and from null, and
 * what Python's float() and JavaScript's Number() convert back. A report
 * holds no null at all. Finite numbers are untouched, so a finite report's
 * bytes are what they always were. dx_graph's Report.to_dict() is
 * json.loads of this same text, so it returns the same strings.
 *
 * Streams (SP2 R4): with `name_stream` it adds "stream": report.stream.
 * Every call site decides; pass NamesStreams(graph), so a one-source
 * report is byte-identical to what it was before streams existed.
