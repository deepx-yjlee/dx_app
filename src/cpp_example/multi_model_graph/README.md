# Multi-model graph example

Run several models over one video stream — detection plus segmentation plus
pose, or a detector feeding a re-identification model on each person it finds
— by writing a **node-graph JSON file**. Which models run, how they are
wired, which regions are cut out and handed on: all of it is data. There is
no C++ to edit and nothing to rebuild.

```bash
./bin/multi_model_graph_async \
    --graph src/cpp_example/multi_model_graph/fanout_od_seg_pose.json \
    --output result.png
```

That command runs a detector, a semantic segmenter and a pose model over one
image and composites all three onto one picture. To make it run a different
detector, change one string:

```diff
-    { "id": "od",   "model": "yolov8n" },
+    { "id": "od",   "model": "yolo26s" },
```

```bash
./setup.sh --models yolo26s        # fetch the .dxnn, once
./bin/multi_model_graph_async --graph .../fanout_od_seg_pose.json --output result.png
```

No `cmake`, no `ninja`, no recompilation — the same binary, reading a
different word out of a JSON file. The same edit works for the segmenter,
the pose model, and every second-stage model in the cascade samples: any of
the 348 entries in [`docs/graph_models.md`](../../../docs/graph_models.md)
whose `produces` and `consumes` columns fit the slot. `--check` tells you
before you run whether they fit.

Two binaries are built from one engine and differ in exactly one value:

| Binary | Executor |
|---|---|
| `multi_model_graph_sync` | one stage at a time, topological order. The reference: slower, and the first thing to try when a result looks wrong |
| `multi_model_graph_async` | dispatch-on-ready. Every node whose inputs are ready is submitted before any of them is waited on |

Both produce the same `FrameReport` for the same input — `--report` writes
it as JSON, and `tests/cpp_example/test_graph_cli.py` compares the two files
byte for byte on real hardware for **every one of the eight shipped sample graphs**,
covering every payload shape they produce — `frame`,
`boxes`, `obboxes`, `keypoints`, `labelmap`, `densemap`, `image`, `scores`
and `vector`.

(An earlier revision of this file claimed `cascade_obb_cls.json` could not
be certified, because the C++ `FrameReport::operator==` is fail-closed for
`obboxes`. That comparator has no non-shipping caller — it exists for the
C++ unit suite. The certification that ships is the `--report` comparison
above, and its serializer handles `obboxes` in full, angle included.)

Shipped samples, next to the CLI sources in `src/cpp_example/multi_model_graph/`:

| File | Shape | Models |
|---|---|---|
| `fanout_od_seg_pose.json` | one frame, three models in parallel | `yolov8n` + `bisenetv2` + `yolov8s_pose` |
| `fanout_od_seg_depth.json` | same, with depth instead of pose | `yolov8n` + `bisenetv2` + `fastdepth_1` |
| `cascade_od_reid_track.json` | detector → per-person crop → embedding, with tracking | `yolov8n` → `casvit_t` |
| `cascade_od_attr.json` | detector → per-person crop → attributes | `yolov8n` → `deepmar_resnet50` |
| `cascade_obb_cls.json` | oriented detector → un-rotated crop → classifier | `yolo26l_obb` → `resnet50` |
| `handoff_denoise_od.json` | denoise, then detect on the denoised image (image hand-off on a plain edge) | `dncnn_color_blind` → `yolov5n` |
| `handoff_sr_od_cls.json` | super-resolve ×2, then detect on the large image → per-person crop → classifier | `realesrgan_x2` → `yolov8n` → `resnet50` |
| `multistream_od_two_sources.json` | two sources, each its own stream, through one shared tracked detector and one reid | `yolov8n` → `casvit_t` |

## The whole vocabulary: two node kinds, two edge kinds

**Nodes**

| Kind | Written as | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| source | `{ "id": "cam", "type": "source", "uri": "..." }` | where frames come from: an image, a video file, `camera:0`, or an `rtsp://` URL. A relative `uri` is resolved against the repository root, so the samples run from any directory. `"source"` is the only `"type"` value the schema defines. A graph may have several source nodes; each one is its own stream (see *Several sources: one stream each*) |
| model | `{ "id": "od", "model": "yolov8n" }` | one model from the registry — note there is **no `"type"`** on a model node. `--list-models` and [`docs/graph_models.md`](../../../docs/graph_models.md) say which names exist |

**Edges**

| Kind | Written as | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| frame | `{ "from": "cam", "to": "od" }` | the consumer gets the whole frame: the source frame, or the image the producer made (see below) |
| ROI | `{ "from": "od", "to": "reid", "roi": { ... } }` | the consumer gets one cropped region per box the producer found, and runs once per crop |
| `port` | `{ "from": "drive", "to": "x", "port": "lane" }` | reads one named output of the producer; without it, the primary output (this example is refused today: no shipped port has an edge-carryable shape; see *Output ports*) |

A model node accepts a frame edge only if it `consumes` `frame` or `either`,
and a ROI edge only if it `consumes` `roi` or `either`. A ROI edge's producer
must emit `boxes`, `obboxes` or `instances`. Both columns are in
`docs/graph_models.md`.

The `consumes` column is each model's **input contract**. It comes from the
model's factory interface by default, and a factory may override it with one
line (see *A model's graph contract*). `vit_pose_small_bn` does: it
`consumes` `either`, so `yolov8n → roi person → vit_pose_small_bn` is a
top-down pose cascade, one pose per person crop, and it still runs on a
whole frame as its single-model example does.

Structural rules that will reject an otherwise sensible-looking graph:

* **A plain edge carries the source frame or the producer's image.** From a
  source it carries the source frame. From a model node that produces
  `image` — denoise, low-light enhancement, super-resolution
  (`--list-models --produces image`) — it hands that model's output image
  to the consumer, which runs on the image as produced (it is never resized
  back to the source size). "Denoise, then detect" is `cam → denoise → od`
  (`handoff_denoise_od.json`); "super-resolve, then detect and classify" is
  `cam → sr → od`, then an ROI edge `od → cls` (`handoff_sr_od_cls.json`).
  Everything else is **rejected** at `--check`, not quietly run on the raw
  frame:
  * a plain edge from a producer of anything but `image` —
    `"seg" produces labelmap, and only an image can be handed off on a plain edge`.
    A `boxes`/`obboxes`/`instances` producer keeps its own message
    (`... "od"'s output would be discarded`) and is told to add `"roi": {}`;
  * a plain edge out of a node that runs per crop (it has an ROI in-edge) —
    `"sr" runs once per crop, so a plain edge would hand off one image per crop`;
  * more than one full-frame image into one node in one stream —
    `receives full-frame input from more than one image: "cam", "denoise"`
    (with several sources the message names the stream:
    `... more than one image in stream "cam1": "sr", "cam1"`).
* **Two sources feeding one node are two streams**, not two inputs:
  `cam1 → od` and `cam2 → od` run `od` once per frame of each;
  `cam1 → sr → od` plus `cam2 → od` runs `od` on `sr`'s image in stream
  `cam1` and on `cam2`'s frame in stream `cam2`. A node is full-frame or
  per-crop in every stream: the frame-and-crops rule below still applies to
  the node as a whole.
* **A node may not receive both a full frame and ROI crops.** Split it into
  two nodes — one for each input. A hand-off edge counts as a full frame.
* **Two edges may not share the same `(from, to)` pair.** To feed one
  producer's output into a consumer twice, add a second consumer node.

### Coordinates after a hand-off

A node's results are in the coordinates of the image it ran on. After a
hand-off that is the producer's image, not the source frame, so every result
carries `origin.inv_align` (emitted as `inv_align` in the `--report` JSON):
the 2×3 affine that maps its coordinates back to the source frame. After ×2
super-resolution a detector reports `inv_align` = `[0.5, 0, 0, 0, 0.5, 0]`;
after `dncnn_color_blind` (512×512 out) on a 640×640 frame, `[1.25, 0, 0, 0,
1.25, 0]`. Chains compose. The renderer applies it, so overlays land on the
source frame.

The size of the handed-off image depends on the model family, because each
family's postprocessor decides it (the image is used as produced):

| Family | Models | Handed-off image |
|---|---|---|
| Super-resolution (Real-ESRGAN) | `realesrgan_x2`, `_x4`, `_x8` | the input size × the factor: 640×480 → 1280×960 at ×2. Aspect ratio kept. |
| Super-resolution (ESPCN) | `espcn_x2`, `_x3`, `_x4` | the input size × the factor (275×150 → 550×300 at ×2): tiled exactly like `espcn_x2_sync` (17×17 tiles, halo 4; `"params": {"sr_tile_halo": N}` overrides it). Aspect ratio kept. |
| Denoising (DnCNN) | `dncnn_*` | always 512×512, the model resolution, whatever the input size. Aspect ratio not kept: a 640×480 frame gives `[1.25, 0, 0, 0, 0.9375, 0]`. |
| Low-light enhancement (Zero-DCE) | `zero_dce`, `zero_dce_pp` | resized back to the input size, so the scale is 1 and `inv_align` is the identity. |

ESPCN in a graph uses the runner's own tiling code, so its `sr` image equals
`espcn_x2_sync`'s `_output_only` image pixel for pixel. The tile is the
model's input (17×17). The halo is taken from the first of these that is
set: the node's `"sr_tile_halo"`, the model's `config.json` `sr_tile_halo`,
the environment variable `DXAPP_SR_TILE_HALO`, then 4. A bad halo fails
when the model loads, as `MODEL_LOAD`: `"sr_tile_halo" must be a whole
number, got 2.5`, or `SR tile halo 9 exceeds the maximum useful overlap`.
DnCNN is not tiled and still hands off 512×512 (see *Not in this release*).

"The input size" is the size of the image the model itself ran on - the
source frame, or the previous image in a chain. A consumer's detectors run
on the handed-off image at that size, so their boxes, and `roi.min_area`
below, are in that image's pixels. Coordinates still map back to the
source frame exactly, through `inv_align`, whatever the aspect ratio.

ROI crops after a hand-off are cut from the **handed-off image**, so the
detail super-resolution added reaches the crop. Each crop's `src_box` and
`inv_align` still map to the source frame. Two `roi` options read
differently there:

* `min_area` is measured in the pixels of the image the producer ran on.
  After ×2 super-resolution a threshold of 100 px² equals 25 source px².
* `pad` is a ratio of the box size, so the scale does not change it.

How a crop's *dense* results (mask, label map, depth, an `image` result, an
instance's mask) land on the source canvas depends on the crop:

* **Plain and scaled crops** - including every crop cut from a
  super-resolved or denoised image - are placed as exact rectangles: the
  crop's own rectangle mapped through `inv_align`.
* **Rotated or aligned crops** - OBB (`obboxes`) and `align: "face5"`,
  including after a hand-off - are warped through `inv_align` at source
  scale, and colour lands only under the warped footprint of the crop, never
  on the bounding rectangle around it.

Boxes and keypoints always go through `inv_align`. An `instances` result is
drawn with its box and label on top of its mask, as a `boxes` result is.

### Output ports

Most models have one output, their `produces` shape. Five also have named
extra outputs, called **ports**. `docs/graph_models.md` shows them after a
`+` in the `produces` column (`boxes + drivable, lane (labelmap)`), and
`--list-models` ends their rows with `  ports: <name>=<shape> ...`:

| Model | Port | Shape | What it holds |
|---|---|---|---|
| `yolopv2` | `drivable` | `labelmap` | the drivable-area mask: 0/1 per pixel, a binary mask, at the size of the image the model ran on |
| `yolopv2` | `lane` | `labelmap` | the lane-line mask, likewise 0/1 and binary |
| `superpoint` | `descriptors` | `densemap` | N×256 float32, row i = the descriptor of keypoint i across the frame's items, in order. Not spatial: no pixel meaning |
| `3ddfa_v2_mobilnetv1_120x120`, `3ddfa_v2_mobilnet0_5_120x120` | `pose` | `vector` | yaw, pitch and roll in degrees, 3 floats per face, concatenated in item order |
| `handlandmarklite_1` | `handedness` | `scores` | one item per hand: `class_name` `Left`/`Right`/`Unknown`, `class_id` 0/1/-1, `confidence` = the hand-presence score |

The primary output keeps its own name: `yolopv2`'s is `boxes`,
`superpoint`'s `keypoints`. It is unchanged by the ports.

**Selecting a port on an edge.** An edge takes the primary output unless it
has `"port": "<name>"`. The port is a separate key, not part of `"from"`,
because node ids may contain dots, so `"from": "drive.lane"` would be
ambiguous. Naming the primary (`"port": "boxes"` on `yolopv2`) is the same
as leaving `"port"` out. Validation:

* `"port"` must be a non-empty string (`GRAPH_SCHEMA`: `"port" must be a
  non-empty string, got 5`).
* A source has no ports: `"cam" is a source; "port" selects one of a
  model's outputs` / `-> remove "port" from this edge`.
* An unknown name lists the real ones: `"drive" has no output port "wings"`
  / `-> its outputs: boxes, drivable, lane`.
* Every shape rule applies to the selected port's shape. The message names
  the port: `"drive" port "drivable" produces labelmap, not boxes` on a ROI
  edge, and `"drive" port "lane" produces labelmap, and only an image can
  be handed off on a plain edge` on a plain one. Without `"port"`, every
  message is what it was before ports existed.
* `"align": "face5"` on a non-primary port is `GRAPH_ALIGN`: the port
  carries no landmarks, so crop from the primary boxes.
* One edge per `(from, to)` pair still holds, so a consumer reads one output
  of a producer.

No shipped port has a shape an edge can carry today. A ROI edge needs
`boxes`, `obboxes` or `instances` and a plain edge needs `image`, so the
example `{ "from": "drive", "to": "x", "port": "lane" }` above is refused
with the plain-edge message. Ports are read from `--report`, the render and
`dx_graph`. An edge that selects a port of a shape it can carry is routed
from that port by both executors. A stage that then leaves that port out of
its result, or fills it with another shape (a plugin that breaks its ports
contract), gives the consumer an empty result and the frame's report an
error, in both executors: `node "cls": "drive" port "people" handed off no
boxes` on a ROI edge, `node "x": "drive" handed off no image` on a plain one.

**Tracking stays on the primary boxes.** `"track"` tracks a node's primary
`boxes`. The tracked result keeps its ports, and crops cut from a
non-primary box port would be untracked (`track_id` -1).

**In `--report`**, a result with ports has a `"ports"` object next to its
`"payload"`, one entry per port in the payload format of its shape. A
result without ports has no `"ports"` key and is byte for byte what it was
before. From `yolopv2` on a 768×576 image:

```json
"ports": {
  "drivable": {"labels": {"cols": 768, "digest": "02aca4279247673d", "nonzero": 19962, "rows": 576, "type": 0}, "shape": "labelmap"},
  "lane": {"labels": {"cols": 768, "digest": "27ed4ab36bdbc998", "nonzero": 4511, "rows": 576, "type": 0}, "shape": "labelmap"}
}
```

**In the render**, each port is drawn in the pass of its shape, right after
its result's primary payload, with the same `origin`. The `yolopv2` masks
blend only their non-zero pixels at alpha 0.5, `drivable` in green and
`lane` in red, the colours of the YOLOPv2 runner. A 3DDFA `pose` prints
`vec[3]` at the face crop and `handedness` prints `Left: 97%` at the hand
crop. SuperPoint's descriptors are not spatial and are never drawn, so its
render is unchanged.

**Memory.** A port lives in its frame's report, so every frame in flight
(up to `--max-inflight`, default 16) holds its ports until its report is
handed out. A `dx_graph` `Report` holds them for as long as you keep it.
Per frame:

* `yolopv2`: 2 × W × H bytes for its two masks, at the size of the image it
  ran on (884,736 bytes for 768×576, about 4 MB for 1920×1080).
* `superpoint`: N × 256 × 4 bytes. With its default `top_k` of 500
  keypoints that is 512,000 bytes, about 0.5 MB.

**SuperPoint tracks are not a port.** `superpoint_sync` also matches
keypoints from frame to frame into tracks. A track needs a step applied to
every frame in frame order. Graph stages decode in completion order, and the
only frame-ordered state the engine keeps is the IoU tracker on box streams,
so tracks would need a new engine concept. The `descriptors` port gives a
`dx_graph` user what tracking needs.

## A complete graph file, annotated

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,                       // 1 is the only version this build runs
  "name": "person-reid",              // free text (a string); in messages and --report

  "nodes": [
    { "id": "cam",  "type": "source",
      "uri": "sample/img/sample_people.jpg" },   // --input overrides this

    { "id": "od",   "model": "yolov8n",
      "params": { "score_threshold": 0.35 },     // overrides the model's config.json
      "track":  { "algo": "iou",                 // one id space for every consumer
                  "iou": 0.3,                    // (0, 1]
                  "max_age": 30 } },             // a whole number, 0 or more

    { "from": "od",  "to": "reid",               // ROI edge: one run per crop
      "roi": { "classes": ["person"],
               "pad": 0.05,                      // 0 to 1: 0.05 is 5 % per side
               "max": 16 } }                     // a whole number, 1 or more
  ]
}
```

(The samples are strict JSON — the `//` comments above are for this document
only. The parser does not accept comments.)

**`track` is a node attribute, not an edge option.** Two edges leaving the
same detector with independent trackers would hand the same boxes two
different id spaces, so `reid`'s track 3 and `attr`'s track 3 would be
different people. Tracking is a property of the detection stream, so it is
declared once, on the producer.

All three `track` keys are optional; `"track": {}` means the defaults.

| Key | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `algo` | the tracker. `"iou"` is the only one; any other value is `GRAPH_SCHEMA` (`unknown tracker "sort"`) | `"iou"` |
| `iou` | the overlap a box needs to continue a track: greater than 0, at most 1 | `0.3` |
| `max_age` | how many frames an unmatched track survives: a whole number, 0 or more. `0` drops a track the first frame it goes unmatched | `30` |

---

## `roi` options

All six are optional; `"roi": {}` means "crop every box, unchanged".

| Key | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `classes` | keep only these class names | all classes |
| `min_score` | confidence floor, 0 to 1, as the producer reports it (`0.35`, not `35`) | the producer's own threshold |
| `min_area` | pixel-area floor, 0 or more, applied after clipping (in the pixels of the producer's input image — see *Coordinates after a hand-off*) | `0` |
| `pad` | grow each box by this fraction of its size on every side before cropping, 0 to 1 (see below) | `0` |
| `max` | keep at most this many boxes, highest score first: a whole number, 1 or more. Leave it out for no limit | no limit |
| `align` | `"face5"` — similarity-transform alignment from five facial landmarks | none |

A value outside these ranges, or a fraction where a whole number is
required, is a `GRAPH_SCHEMA` error at `--check` (see *Error messages*).
`1.0` counts as a whole number. The bound on `pad` is 1 because `pad` is
added on **each** side: `pad: 1` already makes the crop three times the box
in each direction, so the object is a ninth of the crop. Beyond that the
crop is mostly background, and a value such as `5` is almost always a
percentage typed as a whole number (5 % is `0.05`).

`align: "face5"` is rejected at validation time when the producer does not
emit landmarks, so a graph that asks a body detector for an aligned face
crop fails before the NPU is opened rather than producing quietly wrong
crops.

### Operator order (normative)

This order is part of the specification, not an implementation detail:
applying `pad` after `align` produces different crops. Copied verbatim from
`common/graph/roi_router.hpp`:

```
producer boxes
  -> classes / min_score / min_area filter
  -> max cut (descending score)
  -> [track]      when declared on the node; frame-ordered
  -> pad + clip to frame
  -> [align:face5 | un-rotate(OBB)]   affine; inverse recorded in RoiRef
  -> crop
  -> second-stage model input
```

A crop that crosses the frame boundary is clipped. If what remains falls
below `min_area` the ROI is dropped and counted in the frame report's
`skipped_out_of_bounds`.

Every second-stage result is restored to **source-frame coordinates** before
it is reported or drawn, including the inverse of an `align` or OBB
un-rotation, so overlays land where the object actually is.

---

## Parameter precedence

```
factory constructor defaults  <  <task>/<family>/<variant>/config.json  <  node "params"
```

A node's `"params"` overrides the model's `config.json` for that node only,
so the same model can appear twice in one graph with two thresholds. Each
value is a number, a string or an array of strings:

* **A number** works for any key, as before.
* **A string or an array of strings** works only for a key the model reads
  as text. Today that is `class_names`, an array, read by 126 factories
  (111 detectors and 15 instance segmenters). The kinds come
  from a scan of each factory header at build time: `get<std::string>("k")`
  is a string key, `get_string_list("k")` a list key. `--list-models` does
  not show them; the error message for a wrong value names them. The kind
  must match, too: `"class_names": "person"` is refused (`"class_names"
  must be an array of strings for model "yolov8n", got "person"`).
* **Anything else** (`true`, `null`, an object) is refused: `"use_x" must be
  a number, a string or an array of strings, got true` / `-> write a switch
  as 1 or 0`.

`class_names` renames a model's classes for one node. It names class ids in
order, so it can make an ROI filter read naturally:

```jsonc
{ "id": "od", "model": "yolov8n", "params": { "class_names": ["pedestrian"] } },
...
{ "from": "od", "to": "reid", "roi": { "classes": ["pedestrian"] } }
```

Class 0 (COCO's `person`) is now `pedestrian`. A class id past the end of
the list is reported as `class_<id>` (a dog is `class_16`).

A string or list entry may hold any character: the params reach the model's
config parser as JSON, escapes included, so `"class_names": ["car \"sedan\"", "a[1]"]`
arrives exactly as written. The same parser reads `config.json`.

A node that sets any params keeps every list in the model's `config.json`
that it does not name itself: overriding `score_threshold` does not wipe a
`class_names` list from the file.

---

## Error messages

Every failure names **where** (the node or edge), **what** (the fact) and
**how** (the command or edit that fixes it):

```
ERROR [CODE] <where>: <what>
  -> <how>
```

There are twelve codes. `GRAPH_EDGE` and `GRAPH_SCHEMA` have a second row
each, for edge ports and node params. Each example below is real output from
`--check`, except the four marked otherwise.

| Code | When | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `GRAPH_VERSION` | `"version"` is a whole number other than 1 | `ERROR [GRAPH_VERSION] g.json: graph version 2 is not supported by this build`<br>`  -> supports: 1` |
| `GRAPH_SCHEMA` | malformed JSON, a wrong type, a missing or duplicate key, an unreadable file, a value out of range or not a whole number | `ERROR [GRAPH_SCHEMA] edge "od"->"cls": duplicate edge "od" -> "cls"`<br>`  -> declare the connection once; add a second consumer node instead of a second edge`<br>`ERROR [GRAPH_SCHEMA] g.json: "version" must be a whole number, got 1.5`<br>`  -> add "version": 1` |

`MODEL_LOAD` names the node and keeps the runtime's own reason whole. Its
hint depends on how far loading got: after other models loaded, it is the
device-memory hint above (see *Device memory*); for the first model of the
graph it is `check the NPU with dxrt-cli -s, and that <file> was compiled
for this DX-RT version; to download it again: ./setup.sh --models <name>`.

Note the download command in `MODEL_MISSING`: the name it prints is the
**model zoo's** spelling, which is not always the registry's (`yolov8n` is
`YoloV8N` there, `yolo26l_obb` is `yolo26l-obb`). 119 of the 348 registered
models differ this way. `setup.sh --models` accepts either spelling (and
the `.dxnn` file name), in any letter case, but the zoo's name is the
manifest's own spelling, so that is the one the CLI prints. It is compiled into
the binary from `scripts/modelzoo_manifest.json` at build time, so a binary
deployed without a source tree prints the same name.

**Every bad value in one object is reported at once**, as unknown keys are
(below): one `roi`, `track` or `params` object with three bad values gives
one message with all three, and one recovery line that covers each:

```console
$ multi_model_graph_sync --check g.json
ERROR [GRAPH_SCHEMA] g.json edge[1] "od"->"reid": 3 invalid values: "min_score" must be between 0 and 1, got 35; "pad" must be between 0 and 1, got 5; "max" must be a whole number of at least 1, got 0
  -> "min_score" is a confidence as the producer reports it (0.35, not 35); "pad" grows each box by this fraction of its size on every side (0.05 = 5 %); "max" keeps at most this many boxes; leave it out for no limit
```

A bad `"version"` is reported alone, because the version decides how the
rest of the file is read, and unknown keys are reported before bad values,
so a mistyped key is answered as a typo.

---

## Finding out what a graph needs: `--check`

`--check` parses and validates a graph, lists every node with its shape and
its artifact, and names any `.dxnn` that is absent — **without opening the
NPU**. It is the fast loop while writing a graph, and it matters more here
than it did for a single-model example, because one graph now names three to
five models.

```console
$ ./bin/multi_model_graph_sync --check src/cpp_example/multi_model_graph/cascade_od_reid_track.json
OK: graph "person-reid" is valid (3 nodes, 2 edges, 2 models)

node      model                         produces   consumes   artifact
cam       (source)                      frame      -          sample/img/sample_people.jpg
od        yolov8n                       boxes      full_frame yolov8-n_640x640.dxnn  [present]
reid      casvit_t                      vector     either     casvit-t_224x224.dxnn  [present]
```

A graph with several sources gets a `streams:` block after the node table,
naming the nodes each stream runs (a one-source graph prints none):

```console
$ ./bin/multi_model_graph_sync --check src/cpp_example/multi_model_graph/multistream_od_two_sources.json
OK: graph "two-cameras-reid" is valid (4 nodes, 3 edges, 2 models)

node      model                         produces   consumes   artifact
cam1      (source)                      frame      -          sample/img/sample_people.jpg
cam2      (source)                      frame      -          sample/img/sample_person_a1.jpg
od        yolov8n                       boxes      full_frame yolov8-n_640x640.dxnn  [present]
reid      casvit_t                      vector     either     casvit-t_224x224.dxnn  [present]

streams: 2 - one per source node, read in turn, one frame from each
  cam1      -> od, reid
  cam2      -> od, reid
```

The exit code answers *is this graph valid?* — a question a fresh checkout
with nothing downloaded must still be able to ask — so a missing `.dxnn` is
reported here but does not make `--check` fail. A real run does fail on it,
with the same list and the same recovery command.

Because it never opens the NPU, `--check` cannot tell whether the device
can hold every model of the graph at once: that is found out when the
models load (`MODEL_LOAD`, see *Device memory*).

## Finding a model: `--list-models`

```console
$ ./bin/multi_model_graph_async --list-models --consumes roi --produces scores
```

`--consumes` takes `roi`, `frame` or `either`; `--produces` takes a shape
name (`boxes`, `obboxes`, `instances`, `keypoints`, `labelmap`, `densemap`,
`image`, `scores`, `vector`, `boxes3d`). Together they answer the question a
task name cannot: *which model can I put in the second stage?*

Three sources, in order of authority:

1. **`--check <graph.json>`** — what this graph needs, right now.
2. **`--list-models`** — what this binary can run. Authoritative after you
   add your own model.
3. **[`docs/graph_models.md`](../../../docs/graph_models.md)** — the same
   table, generated from the same registry. The build writes its own copy
   (`build_x86_64/generated/graph_models.md`) and never rewrites the tracked
   file; after a registry change, update it with
   `python3 scripts/gen_model_registry.py --docs-only`. The guard
   `python3 scripts/check_graph_models_doc.py` fails, naming that command,
   when the tracked file is stale.

---

## Reserved keys

The design reserves grammar for three features this release does not
implement. Two of them have a spelling in the schema and are rejected by
name with `GRAPH_RESERVED`, so a graph written against a future release
fails loudly instead of being silently misread:

| Reserved | Why it is rejected rather than ignored |
|---|---|
| `"prompt"` on a node | Text-conditioned models need a tokenizer, which this build does not have. Ignoring the key would run the model unconditioned and quietly return the wrong thing |
| `"type": "fuse"` on a node | Multi-model fusion formulas are model-specific and must be designed against a real model spec. A `fuse` node that silently became a pass-through would change results without saying so |

The third — a condition/rule expression grammar on edges — has **no key in
v1**: an expression language is a small language, permanently bound by
backward compatibility once shipped, so none was chosen.

## Unknown keys are an error

Every other key the schema does not define is rejected too, with the key
named, its location named, and — when something close exists — the key you
probably meant:

```console
$ multi_model_graph_sync --check typo.json
ERROR [GRAPH_SCHEMA] typo.json edge[1] "od"->"reid" "roi": 2 unknown keys: "classez", "paddng"
  -> did you mean "classes" for "classez", "pad" for "paddng"? accepted keys: classes, min_score, min_area, pad, max, align
```

This holds at every level — top level, node, `track`, edge and `roi` — and
it matters more here than in most configuration formats: a dropped key does
not stop the graph, it runs it with the option missing, and nothing prompts
you to look. Three details worth knowing:

* **Every unknown key in one object is reported at once**, so fixing a file
  with several typos takes one round trip, not one per typo.
* **A mistyped *required* key is answered as a typo**, not as a missing
  key: `{"form": "cam"}` gives `unknown key "form" -> did you mean "from"?`.
* **The accepted keys are always listed**, even when nothing is close
  enough to guess — a wrong suggestion is worse than none.

A key that is genuinely absent rather than mistyped gets the location and a
recovery line of its own:

```console
ERROR [GRAPH_SCHEMA] g.json node[1] (model "yolov8n"): missing required key "id"
  -> add "id": a name unique within this graph
```

Node `"type"` values are checked the same way. `"source"` is the only type;
a model node carries a `"model"` name and no `"type"` at all. In
particular `{"type": "model", "model": "yolov8n"}` — a natural thing to
write — is **rejected**, because it used to be accepted only by accident.

Two deliberate exceptions to the key rule:

* **`params` keys are open; values are numbers unless the model reads that
  key as text.** Its keys are model parameter names, not schema keys, so
  any key with a number is accepted and passed through to the model (see
  *Parameter precedence* for text).
* **`$schema` is accepted and ignored** at the top level, so an editor can
  attach a JSON-schema reference for completion and inline validation.
  Nothing else in this schema is within two edits of it, so tolerating it
  cannot hide a typo for a real key. The tolerance stops there — a
  `"_comment"` key is rejected; `"name"` already carries intent, and every
  extra tolerated key is somewhere a typo can hide.

And one ordering rule: **a version this build does not support wins
first.** A graph marked `"version": 2` is answered with `GRAPH_VERSION`,
not with a list of unknown keys, because a later release's keys are unknown
to this build by definition.

---

## When a run produces nothing, it says so

Some mistakes only exist at run time. A class name that matches nothing —
`"classes": ["persons"]` when the detector emits `person` — passes
`--check`, runs, exits 0, and hands the second stage zero crops. Nothing
about that is distinguishable from a frame in which the detector genuinely
found no people, so the run says which it was:

```console
warning: edge "od"->"reid" produced no crops, although "od" found 3 boxes
  the "roi" filter on this edge sets: "classes": ["persons"] "max"
  "od" emitted these classes: dog, person
  -> check the class names against that list, or relax "min_score"/"min_area"/"max"
```

The typo is printed next to the truth. The warning goes to stderr, fires
at most once per edge per run, and never changes the exit code — a
detector that legitimately finds nothing stays silent, because the warning
is raised only when the producer *did* emit boxes and the filter kept none
of them.

---

## Platforms

- **Linux x86_64** is built and tested (the unit binaries, the graph tests,
  the CLI).
- **aarch64** is compile-checked only: `scripts/check_cross_compile.sh`
  compiles the engine and the CLI with the cross compiler
  (`-fsyntax-only`); nothing is linked or run on aarch64. Concurrency and
  `--max-inflight` were validated with x86_64 dxrt.
- **Windows** is **not built on Windows here**. The graph targets get MSVC
  flags (`/bigobj`, C5038 and C4062 as errors), and Ctrl-C goes through
  `SetConsoleCtrlHandler`: repeats within 200 ms are one request, a later
  press terminates, and Ctrl-Break terminates at once. `tests\windows\run_tests.bat
  graph` runs the CLI smoke tests. All of it was checked on Linux only; see
  *Graph engine on Windows* in `docs/source/docs/02_DX-APP_Installation_and_Build.md`.

## Not in this release

| Wanted | Status |
|---|---|
| **Multi-model fusion** (`"type": "fuse"`) | Grammar reserved, rejected with `GRAPH_RESERVED` |
| **Text-conditioned models** (`"prompt"`) | Grammar reserved, rejected with `GRAPH_RESERVED` |
| **Condition / rule expressions on edges** | No key in v1; an expression language is a small language and permanently binding once shipped |
| **3D / LiDAR models** (`boxes3d`) | Rejected in a camera graph: the input is not a camera frame |
| **SuperPoint tracks in a graph** | Needs an ordered per-stream step; the descriptors port is available |
| **DnCNN resized back to the input size** | Hand-off hands off as produced: DnCNN's image stays 512×512 |

## Several sources: one stream each

A graph may declare more than one source node
(`multistream_od_two_sources.json` has two, `cam1` and `cam2`). **Each
source is its own stream**: the source and every node reachable from it.

**Models are shared, frames are not.** A model node has one engine on the
NPU, loaded once, and that engine carries the jobs of every stream that
reaches the node: four cameras through three models are three engines, not
twelve. Everything about frames is per stream. Each stream has its own
frame sequence and its own reports, and a node that declares `track` keeps
one tracker per stream, so track ids never cross streams: track 3 in `cam1`
and track 3 in `cam2` are unrelated objects. A frame runs only the nodes of
its own stream, on that stream's frame or hand-off, and never waits for a
node that only another stream reaches. A frame that fails, fails in its own
stream; the other streams run on. (The async executor's
`node "x" never completed`, a scheduler defect that a validated graph never
produces, likewise only ever names a node of the frame's own stream.)

**Reports.** With several sources every frame in `--report` carries
`"stream": "<source_id>"`, and its `"index"` counts the frames of that
stream (0, 1, ... in each). A one-source report has no `"stream"` key: it
is byte for byte what it was before streams existed.

**Order.** The streams are read in turn: one frame from each stream still
reading, in source declaration order, round after round. Both executors
emit reports in the order frames were read, so `multi_model_graph_sync` and
`multi_model_graph_async` write the same bytes, the two-source sample
included. Two videos of 8 frames (`cam1`) and 5 frames (`cam2`) give this
`(stream, index)` sequence:

```
cam1 0, cam2 0, cam1 1, cam2 1, cam1 2, cam2 2, cam1 3, cam2 3,
cam1 4, cam2 4, cam1 5, cam1 6, cam1 7
```

**Ends.** Each stream ends on its own, when its source gives no more
frames; the run ends when every stream has ended. `--frames N` is per
stream: N frames of each, and a stream that has given N is never read
again (a camera does not grab an N+1-th frame). Live and file sources mix:
`--input cam1=camera:0 --input cam2=clip.mp4 --frames 100` reads 100 camera
frames even when the clip is shorter. Because the streams are read in turn,
a file stream next to a camera is read at the camera's pace.

**Back-pressure.** `--max-inflight` is one window shared by every stream,
not a window per stream: it bounds the frames in flight across all of them.
Because frames are admitted in turn, while k streams are reading, any M
consecutive admissions hold at most ⌈M/k⌉ frames of one stream: a fast
stream cannot take the slots of a slow one. The cost is head-of-line
blocking: reports leave in admission order, so a slow stream - a slow
camera, or frames that take long to finish - holds back the others, never
the reverse.

**Inputs.** `--input <source_id>=<uri>` replaces one source's `uri`; repeat
it once per source, and a source you do not name reads its own `uri`. The
named form works on a one-source graph too (`--input cam=clip.mp4`). A bare
`--input <uri>` names the only source of a one-source graph; with several
sources it is a usage error, exit 2, before any model loads:

```console
$ ./bin/multi_model_graph_async --graph src/cpp_example/multi_model_graph/multistream_od_two_sources.json --input clip.mp4
--input "clip.mp4" does not say which source it replaces: graph "two-cameras-reid" has 2 source nodes (cam1, cam2); write --input <source_id>=<uri>, e.g. --input cam1=clip.mp4
```

The other `--input` usage errors, each exit 2 before any model loads:

* the same source twice (`--input cam1=a.mp4 --input cam1=b.mp4`, or two
  bare values on a one-source graph): `--input names source "cam1" twice`;
* `<source_id>=` with no uri after it: `--input cam2= has no uri after "="`;
* an empty value (`--input ""`): `--input needs a value`;
* a misspelled id on a graph with several sources:
  `--input "camX=a.mp4" does not say which source it replaces: "camX" is not a source node of graph "two-cameras-reid"; its source nodes: cam1, cam2`.

`<id>=` is read as a source name only when `<id>` is the id of a source
node, so a uri that contains `=` stays a uri:
`--input 'rtsp://host/stream?user=a'` replaces the source of a one-source
graph. On a graph with several sources, a prefix that has a `/`, `\` or
`:` in it, and so could begin a path or a URL, gets the "does not say which
source" message above rather than the misspelled-id one.

**Outputs.** `--output` writes one set of files per stream:

* a video extension (`.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mkv`): one video per stream,
  `<stem>_<source_id><ext>` (`--output run.mkv` writes `run_cam1.mkv` and
  `run_cam2.mkv`), each at its own stream's frame rate and frame size;
* any other extension: `<stem>_<source_id>_<index><ext>` for every frame,
  `<index>` in six digits (`run_cam1_000000.png`), even from a source that is
  a single image - with several sources images are always numbered. No
  extension means `.png`, as with one source.

The live-source refusal (image output from `camera:` or `rtsp://` without
`--frames`) is checked for each stream's own uri, and the missing-directory
check names the first file a stream would write:
`could not write out/run_cam1.mkv: directory out does not exist` (exit 1).
`--display` opens one window per stream, titled
`multi_model_graph: <source_id>`; `q` or ESC in any of them stops the whole
run, as Ctrl-C does. A stop request stops
reading every stream, finishes the frames in flight in every stream, and
finalizes `--report` and every output file.

**Messages.** With several sources the `input:` lines name their streams,
a failed frame is reported on stderr as `stream cam1 frame 3: <error>`, and
the summary gives one `stream <source_id>: N frames, F failed` line per
stream before the total (lines from the runtime left out):

```console
$ ./bin/multi_model_graph_sync --graph src/cpp_example/multi_model_graph/multistream_od_two_sources.json --input cam1=clip.avi --report report.json
graph:  two-cameras-reid (4 nodes, 3 edges)
input:  cam1: Video file: clip.avi
input:  cam2: Image file: sample/img/sample_person_a1.jpg
report: report.json
stream cam1: 8 frames, 0 failed
stream cam2: 1 frame, 0 failed
9 frames, 0 failed
```

`--check` lists the streams, and the nodes each one runs, after the node table
(see *Finding out what a graph needs: `--check`*). A stream whose source gives
no frame at all does not stop the others: they run to their end, then the run
prints `ERROR [GRAPH_SCHEMA] source "<uri>": produced no frames` for each
empty stream and exits 1. `--report` and `--output` hold every frame the other
streams gave, and the `output:`, `report:` and per-stream summary lines are
printed as in any finished run (the empty stream's own is `0 frames`). A stop
request that arrives while the models load prints `interrupted before the
first frame` and blames no stream (exit 0), as with one source.

---

## Tracking costs latency

An IoU tracker is stateful and strictly frame-ordered: feeding it frame 3
before frame 2 breaks the ids. The design (spec §4.5) keeps detection
inference parallel and makes only the tracking step wait for frame order.
**Every asynchronous graph pays reorder latency** — a frame that finishes
early waits until every earlier frame has been handed out — **and a graph that
declares `track` additionally serializes its tracking step at a gate per node and stream**,
so one slow frame holds back the tracking of every later one of its stream. Throughput is
unaffected: inference for later frames keeps running.

This build does that. The asynchronous executor keeps up to `--max-inflight`
frames in flight (default 16). A tracked node's results are applied in frame
order through a gate per node and stream: frame N+1 of a stream waits at it
until frame N of the same stream has run, frames of other streams never touch
it, and inference for later frames keeps running on the NPU. Finished
reports pass through a reorder buffer and come out in the order the frames
were read (frame order, with one source), each equal to what the synchronous
executor produces for that frame. A finished frame
still waiting in that buffer counts toward `--max-inflight`, so a frame that is
slow to finish stops the sources from being read further ahead rather than
letting the buffer grow without bound.

---

## Device memory

Every model node opens its own engine on the NPU, even two nodes that name
the same model, and each engine holds its own device memory; other
processes using the NPU draw on the same memory. A graph whose engines do
not fit fails while it loads, with `MODEL_LOAD` on the first node that does
not fit. On DX-M1, a second `realesrgan_x2` next to `yolov8n`, `resnet50`
and a first `realesrgan_x2` cannot load (the example under *Error
messages*).

`--check` cannot predict this: it never opens the NPU, and the runtime
exposes no reliable per-model device-memory figure to add up. When it
happens, remove a node or use a smaller model.

---

## Options

| Option | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `--graph <file>` | — | the graph to run |
| `--input [<source>=]<uri>` | each source node's `uri` | image, video, `camera:<N>`, `rtsp://...`. Repeatable, once per source: `<source>=` names the source node it replaces, and a graph with several sources needs it (see *Several sources: one stream each*) |
| `--output <file>` | none | the rendered result. `.mp4`, `.avi` or `.mkv` (any letter case): one video (codec `mp4v` for `.mp4`/`.mkv`, `MJPG` for `.avi`; the source's fps when it is between 1 and 240, else 30). Any other extension, or none: images, exactly `<file>` for a single image, `<stem>_<index><ext>` for each frame of a multi-frame source. Images from a live source (`camera:`, `rtsp://`, from `--input` or the graph's `uri`) never end, so they need `--frames N`; without it the run is refused (exit 2) before any model loads. A directory that does not exist fails before any model loads too (`could not write <file>: directory <dir> does not exist`, exit 1). With several sources, one file set per stream: one video `<stem>_<source_id><ext>` each, or images `<stem>_<source_id>_<index><ext>`, always numbered; both checks apply to each stream |
| `--display` | off | show each rendered frame in a window. `q` or ESC stops the run gracefully, as Ctrl-C does; closing the window does not stop it (the next frame reopens it). Needs a window system: with none of `DISPLAY`, `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, `QT_QPA_PLATFORM` set it is refused (exit 2). One that is set but does not answer (`DISPLAY=:99` with no server there, `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb` without `DISPLAY`) is refused the same way, before any model loads: a window is opened once in a child process first, because Qt aborts the process that cannot connect. With several sources, one window per stream, `multi_model_graph: <source_id>`; `q` or ESC in any of them stops the run |
| `--report <file>` | none | every `FrameReport` as JSON, ordered by `(node, parent_index, roi_index)`. Written frame by frame and finalized on every exit short of a kill (see *`--report`* below) |
| `--model-dir <dir>` | `assets/models` | where the `.dxnn` files are |
| `--max-inflight <N>` | `16` | frames in flight at once; at least 1. Async only: `multi_model_graph_sync` refuses it (exit 2) |
| `--max-jobs-per-stage <N>` | `0` | jobs one stage may have outstanding across frames; 0 = no limit. Async only: `multi_model_graph_sync` refuses it (exit 2) |
| `--stall-timeout-ms <N>` | `0` | fail with `ERROR: AsyncExecutor stalled: …` (exit 1) when work is outstanding and nothing completes for N ms; 0 = wait forever. Async only: `multi_model_graph_sync` refuses it (exit 2) |

`--max-jobs-per-stage` and `--stall-timeout-ms` are `dx_graph`'s
`max_jobs_per_stage` and `stall_timeout_ms`: non-negative whole numbers, so
`-1`, `1.5` or a missing value is a usage error naming the option. Every
numeric option (`--frames` too) takes at most 2147483647; a larger value is
a usage error as well. The sync
binary runs one frame at a time and would ignore all three async-only
options, so it refuses them instead:

```console
$ ./bin/multi_model_graph_sync --graph g.json --max-inflight 4
--max-inflight applies to multi_model_graph_async only: this binary runs one frame at a time
```

The live-source and `--display` refusals, word for word:

```console
$ ./bin/multi_model_graph_async --graph g.json --input camera:0 --output out.png
--output out.png writes one image per frame, and "camera:0" is a live source that never ends: write a video instead (--output <stem>.mkv, .avi or .mp4) or stop after N frames (--frames N)
$ ./bin/multi_model_graph_async --graph g.json --display      # no window system
--display needs a window system, and neither DISPLAY nor WAYLAND_DISPLAY is set: run it in a desktop session, or save the result with --output
$ DISPLAY=:99 ./bin/multi_model_graph_async --graph g.json --display   # nothing on :99
--display could not open a window with DISPLAY=:99: no window system answered there; run it in a desktop session, or save the result with --output
```

Exit codes: `0` success, `1` a `GraphError` (the graph or its models cannot
run) or a failed frame, `2` a usage error.

Ctrl-C **and SIGTERM** are graceful: the input loop stops reading, the
frames already in flight finish (in every stream) and `--report` / `--output`
are finalized;
the exit code is the run's own (`0` when every frame succeeded). A stop
request that arrives while the models load ends the run before the first
frame: `interrupted before the first frame`, `0 frames, 0 failed`, exit 0.
A later
Ctrl-C, more than 200 ms after the first request, terminates at once, for a
wind-down that is itself stuck; repeats within 200 ms (a wrapper such as
`timeout` forwarding the same keypress) count as the same request. SIGTERM
never escalates (`timeout` may deliver it twice). To force an end, follow it
with SIGKILL: `timeout` does that only when given `-k`, as in
`timeout -k 10 60 ./bin/...`. `q` or ESC in the `--display` window is the
same graceful stop, so a Ctrl-C more than 200 ms after it terminates too.

A run that is terminated that way, or killed, finalizes nothing. `--report`
then holds every finished frame and needs its closing lines (below). A
video is left without its closing index: an `.mp4` has no `moov` atom and
OpenCV and most players cannot open it at all, while an `.mkv` or `.avi`
still plays up to about the last frames written. So after the first stop
request, let the run finish; if you may have to kill it, write `.mkv` or
`.avi`.

### `--report`

- **Written as each frame finishes**, not held until the input ends, so
  memory stays bounded on a camera or RTSP source that runs for hours. The
  file is opened when the source opens, before the first frame: a path that
  cannot be written fails at once (`could not write <path>`, exit 1).
- **The bytes are those of a whole-file dump**: `{"frames": [...],
  "graph": "<name>"}`, indented by two spaces, with a trailing newline. The
  sync and async binaries write byte-identical files.
- **Every exit short of a kill finalizes it**: the normal end; Ctrl-C,
  SIGTERM, `q`/ESC; a frame whose `--output` cannot be written; an error that
  stops the run, such as `--stall-timeout-ms`; a source that produced no
  frames (exit 1; `"frames": []` with one source, every frame of the other
  streams with several); and a stop request before the first frame
  (`"frames": []`, exit 0).
- **After a SIGKILL** (or a terminating second Ctrl-C) the file holds every
  frame finished so far and ends with that frame's closing `    }`, so a JSON
  parser rejects it. Each frame goes out in one write, so appending the
  closing lines repairs it (the graph's `"name"`, `""` when it has none):

  ```bash
  printf '\n  ],\n  "graph": "%s"\n}\n' person-reid >> report.json
  ```

  If no frame had finished, the file ends with `[`: then the format is
  `'],\n  "graph": "%s"\n}\n'` instead. In the rare case the kill lands
  inside a frame's write, that frame is cut short: delete back to the
  previous frame's closing `    }` first.
- **NaN and infinities** are written as the strings `"NaN"`, `"Infinity"`
  and `"-Infinity"`. JSON has no such numbers, and strict parsers
  (JavaScript's `JSON.parse`, `jq`, nlohmann's own `json::parse`) reject
  bare `NaN`/`Infinity` tokens; a string is valid everywhere, and Python's
  `float()` and JavaScript's `Number()` turn it back into the number. Finite
  values are unchanged, and no report contains `null`. Two report files with
  NaN in the same place compare equal as text, while the C++
  `FrameReport::operator==` treats NaN as never equal, so an in-memory
  comparison of a NaN-bearing report fails by design.

## A model's graph contract

What a model `consumes` and which ports it has come from its factory
interface (`IPoseFactory`, `IDetectionFactory`, ...), through the table in
`scripts/gen_model_registry.py`. A factory overrides either one with a
single line in its header:

```cpp
static constexpr GraphInput graphInput() { return GraphInput::kEither; }   // kFullFrame, kRoi or kEither
static constexpr const char* graphPorts() { return "descriptors"; }       // comma-separated port names
```

`vit_pose_small_bn` declares `graphInput()` (`kEither`) and `superpoint`
declares `graphPorts()`. The build's code generator parses those lines out of
the header, so no factory is instantiated to learn its contract. Every
generated registry row also carries a `static_assert` that the factory's own
declaration equals what the generator parsed. A declaration the generator
misread or missed, such as one inherited from another factory, then fails
the build (`graphInput() and gen_model_registry.py disagree`) instead of
shipping the interface default.

A factory header that mentions `graphInput` or `graphPorts` anywhere, in a
comment too, must hold exactly one declaration in the form above, or
generation fails with `UNPARSEABLE TRAIT <header>`. So a comment that names
a trait in a header that declares none, or that quotes the declaration a
second time, stops the build. A port name must also be one the generator
knows for the factory's result type (`UNKNOWN PORT`).

`vit_pose_small_bn` also decodes its output as the 17 VitPose heatmaps it
is, as the Python example does, where it used to run a YOLOv8-pose decoder.
Its C++ and Python keypoints agree to within 2e-5. It no longer reads
`score_threshold` or `nms_threshold`.

## Your own registry (`IModelRegistry`)

The engine reads models only through `IModelRegistry`
(`common/graph/i_registry.hpp`). A registry of your own, such as a plugin,
implements that interface. This release added fields to the structs it
passes, so code built against an earlier `i_registry.hpp` (or the
`shape.hpp` it includes) must be rebuilt:

* `StageResult::ports` (in `shape.hpp`): a stage's extra outputs, by name.
  The PORTS CONTRACT in `i_registry.hpp` says what a stage must put there.
* `ModelInfo::ports`, a list of `PortInfo {name, shape}`: the extra outputs
  a model declares.
* `ModelInfo::text_params`, a list of `ParamInfo {name, kind}` with `kind`
  `kText` or `kTextList`: the params keys the model reads as a string or a
  list of strings. Every other key is a number.
* `StageParams::text` and `StageParams::lists`: a node's string and
  string-array params, next to the existing `numeric`.

Leaving them empty gives the old behaviour: no ports, and numbers only.

## From Python

The same graphs run from Python through the `dx_graph` module, which is built
by the same CMake build and links this engine — not a copy of it:

```python
import dx_graph

with dx_graph.Graph("src/cpp_example/multi_model_graph/cascade_od_reid_track.json") as g:
    for report in g.stream(source="my_video.mp4"):   # --input; pipelined as the async CLI
        d = report.to_dict()                         # this frame's --report entry
        canvas = g.render(report)                    # this frame's --output image
```

Reports, renderings and error messages are the CLI's own, checked on hardware
by `tests/cpp_example/test_graph_python.py`. Every `run()` and `stream()`
starts with the graph's trackers reset, as the CLI starts on its input, so a
reused Graph gives what a fresh one gives; track ids follow objects across
the frames of one stream. A graph with several sources reads them all with
`g.stream()` or `g.stream(sources={"cam1": a, "cam2": b})` (the CLI's
`--input cam1=a --input cam2=b`); each report's `.stream` names its source.
`to_dict()` holds the same `"NaN"` / `"Infinity"`
/ `"-Infinity"` strings as the `--report` file, a model the device cannot
load raises `dx_graph.GraphError` with `.code == "MODEL_LOAD"`, and the
executor options are the constructor's `max_frames_in_flight`,
`max_jobs_per_stage` and `stall_timeout_ms`. One difference: the CLI stops
gracefully on SIGTERM, while a Python program keeps Python's default SIGTERM
action (the process ends at once); `dx_graph` installs no signal handler.
`./build.sh --all --python_exec <your python>` builds the module for that
interpreter and ships it as `bin/python/dx_graph` (the default `./build.sh`,
`--minimal`, does not). Build, API, threading and limits:
[`src/bindings/python/dx_graph/README.md`](../../bindings/python/dx_graph/README.md).

## Retargeting a sample without rebuilding

This is the claim the example exists to make, so it is worth trying:

```bash
# edit cascade_od_reid_track.json: "model": "yolov8n" -> "yolo26s"
./setup.sh --models yolo26s
./bin/multi_model_graph_async \
    --graph src/cpp_example/multi_model_graph/cascade_od_reid_track.json \
    --output /tmp/swapped.png
```

No rebuild, no recompilation, no code change. The same holds for swapping
`bisenetv2` for any other model whose `produces` column says `labelmap`, or
`casvit_t` for anything that `consumes` `roi` or `either`.
