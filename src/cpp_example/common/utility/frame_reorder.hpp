/**
 * @brief Reorders async display items back into submission order.
 *
 * The async runners push each completed frame into their display queue from
 * inside the dxrt completion callback, and the display thread renders / writes
 * (VideoWriter) in pop order. RunAsync completions do NOT preserve submission
 * order — postprocess runs in the callback thread, so a heavier frame can
 * finish after a lighter successor — so without this buffer a saved video comes
 * out locally shuffled inside the in-flight window, which reads as jitter on
 * playback. Frame *count* stays correct, so it is a silent defect.
 *
 * Usage: assign a monotonic index at submit time (``AsyncUserData::frame_index``,
 * carried through to the display args), then feed every popped item through
 * push() and call drain() once the queue is finished.
 *
 * @tparam T display-args type with a ``uint64_t frame_index`` member.
