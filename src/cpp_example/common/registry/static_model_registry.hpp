/**
 * @file static_model_registry.hpp
 * @brief IModelRegistry backed by the generated tables.
 *
 * Swapping this for a dlopen-based registry changes nothing above it: the
 * graph schema, the executors, the router and the visualizer all name only
 * i_registry.hpp.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE IS NOT UNDER common/graph/
 * ----------------------------------------
 * This is a CONCRETE registry, and common/graph/ is the engine.
 * scripts/check_graph_boundary.py's whole purpose is to stop engine code
 * from naming or including one, so the concrete registry lives outside the
 * directory the guard polices, not inside it with an exemption. In
 * particular it is deliberately NOT added to ENGINE_INCLUDE_ALLOWLIST:
 * allowlisting it would make every engine file free to include it and would
 * defeat the guard entirely. Where it is now, two independent checks fire if
 * an engine file ever includes it - it is outside the engine's allowed
 * include surface, and its path names a registry - which is strictly
 * stronger than the allowlist entry the boundary guard was written to
 * prevent.
 *
 * Only two kinds of translation unit include this header: the generated
 * build/generated/graph_registry_*.cpp tables, and the test binary under
 * common/graph/test/ (which the guard exempts because fixtures legitimately
 * construct a concrete registry).
