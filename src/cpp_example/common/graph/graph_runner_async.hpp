/**
 * @file graph_runner_async.hpp
 * @brief Dispatch-on-ready executor, harvesting on completion.
 *
 * Every job's callback records its result into that job's collector and
 * pushes a notice into a completion queue this executor owns. One driver
 * thread - the caller's - drains the queue: a node whose last job has come
 * back is harvested, its successors are released, and whatever became ready
 * is submitted at once. Nothing waits on flush(). flush() waits for EVERY
 * job outstanding on a stage, so a flush-driven harvest cannot tell one
 * job's completion from another's; completion-driven harvesting can, which
 * is what lets this executor keep several frames on one stage at once.
 *
 * When the queue is empty the driver asks one stage at a time to deliver
 * what it holds (IStage::poll(), clause (6)) - oldest outstanding
 * submission first - and processes completions after each. On real
 * hardware poll() is a no-op and callbacks arrive on the runtime's own
 * thread; with the test fake, poll() is what delivers, and polling one
 * stage at a time is what keeps a cascade child submitted while its
 * parent's siblings are still outstanding (TestAsyncOverlapsAcrossDepth).
 * Polling every stage at once would deliver the siblings together and the
 * overlap would vanish from the measurement, not from the hardware.
 *
 * If nothing is deliverable the driver waits on the queue in slices of
 * AsyncOptions::wait_slice_ms, checking the interrupt hook between slices.
 *
 * The three parity rules (spec 4.5) that make this agree with SyncExecutor:
 *
 *  1. Completions arrive in whatever order the runtime hands them back, so a
 *     node's ROI results are stable_sorted into ByOrigin order - the single
 *     comparator declared in stage_graph.hpp and shared with SyncExecutor.
 *  2. The tracker is stateful and must see frames in order. Each (stream,
 *     tracked node) pair has a gate holding the next frame of that stream it
 *     may track, counted in that stream's admission order; a completion for
 *     a later frame of the stream is parked until every earlier frame of the
 *     stream has passed - harvested, or skipped because it never reached
 *     that node (an empty frame). Frames of other streams never touch it.
 *     Only this CPU step is serialized; later frames' inference keeps
 *     running. ApplyTrackIds stays the sole writer of track_id in the tree.
 *  3. Nothing here accumulates floating point across stages.
 *
 * Reports are emitted in admission order: a frame that finishes early waits
 * in a buffer until every earlier frame has been handed out. That buffer is
 * inside the frame cap: a finished report still waiting behind an unfinished
 * frame counts as in flight, so a slow or lost head frame stops admission
 * instead of letting the source be read without bound (see Submit()).
 * The window is shared by every stream: the span runs over admission order
 * whatever the stream, and reports come out in admission order (SP2 R1, R2).
 *
 * report.error holds one message; errors are recorded per node and resolved
 * in topological order when the frame finishes, as SyncExecutor does.
