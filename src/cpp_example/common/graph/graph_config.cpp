// Carried over from Task 6's review: GCC's -Wdangling-reference fired at the
// two RequireArray("nodes"/"edges", ..., "") call sites below (originally
// graph_config.cpp:189, :269). RequireKey/RequireArray return a reference
// into parent's own storage (root, a local that outlives every use of the
// returned reference within ParseGraphText) — never into detail — so the
// warning is a genuine false positive: GCC's heuristic fires whenever *any*
// call argument requires materializing a temporary, without checking which
// parameter the returned reference actually depends on. The "" literal at
// those two sites was exactly such a temporary (converted to a temporary
// std::string bound to the const std::string& detail parameter). Passing a
// stable named lvalue instead of the literal removes that temporary at the
// source, which satisfies the heuristic without weakening the function
// signatures (detail stays a plain const&, so every other call site that
// already passes an lvalue - a `detail.str()` result stored in a variable,
// or a forwarded reference parameter - remains warning-free, unlike a
// by-value parameter, which would newly warn at those additional sites: a
// by-value parameter still copy-constructs a temporary from any argument,
// lvalue or not, at the call site, so a fix at that granularity trades two
// warnings for four instead of clearing them).
