/**
 * @file i_registry.hpp
 * @brief The replaceable boundary between the engine and the model zoo.
 *
 * NORMATIVE. Three rules hold for every file under common/graph/:
 *
 *  1. The engine never includes a concrete registry. graph_config,
 *     graph_runner_sync, graph_runner_async, roi_router and graph_visualizer
 *     include only this header and take the interface by constructor
 *     injection.
 *  2. The registry knows nothing about graph semantics. It has no notion of
 *     nodes, edges or validation rules. It answers "name -> info" and
 *     "name -> stage".
 *  3. ModelInfo exposes value types only. No pointer containers, no
 *     templates, no handles.
 *  4. A ModelInfo* handed out by find() stays valid for the registry's
 *     whole lifetime, and NO other call on that registry invalidates it -
 *     createStage() included. See find()'s own comment for why this is the
 *     rule that most needs an implementer's attention.
 *
 * A later plugin registry replaces the implementation and nothing else:
 * the graph schema, the executors, the router, the visualizer and this
 * header all stay as they are.
 *
 * Limitation: std::string crossing a .so boundary is safe only within one
 * toolchain. A third-party plugin built with a different compiler needs a C
 * ABI shim. This interface has five methods, so that shim is a mechanical
 * 1:1 wrapper.

/**
 * @brief A model, type-erased. The only model abstraction the engine sees.
 *
 * Hardware facts (Task 3 spike, dxrt::InferenceEngine, confirmed 4/4 runs
 * across 3 models) that a real implementation of this interface must honour
 * at the point of use:
 *
 *  - Wait(jobId) returns empty output once a callback is registered on that
 *    engine. A real stage must take its result from the callback, never
 *    from a Wait() return value, even on the synchronous run() path.
 *  - A blocking Run() also fires the registered per-engine callback (5
 *    Run() calls with zero RunAsync produced exactly 5 callback fires). A
 *    real stage that offers both run() and submit() against one underlying
 *    engine with one registered callback must not let the synchronous path
 *    re-enter or double-fire the asynchronous completion path — run() and
 *    submit() completions share the same callback, so the implementation
 *    has to disambiguate which logical call a given callback fire belongs
 *    to (e.g. by job id), not assume submit()'s callback is the only source
 *    of completions.
 *
 * THROW CONTRACT (NORMATIVE). The two execution paths report failure
 * differently, and an implementation that mixes them up breaks sync/async
 * parity on the error path - a divergence no fake can demonstrate, because
 * a fake chooses which path it fails on:
 *
 *  - run() THROWS std::runtime_error on any failure. The synchronous
 *    executor wraps every run() in try/catch and turns the message into
 *    report.error.
 *  - submit() DOES NOT THROW. Every failure - an unusable input, a
 *    preprocessing error, a runtime that refuses the submission, a
 *    postprocessing error - is reported through the StageCallback's
 *    `error` argument, carrying the same message run() would have thrown.
 *    One error channel, not two: a job that fails before it reaches the
 *    hardware must be indistinguishable, to the caller, from one that
 *    fails on it. Without this rule the asynchronous executor would have
 *    to handle failures two ways and would still not agree with the
 *    synchronous one about which node's message survives.
 *  - flush() DOES NOT THROW, and must genuinely block until every
 *    submitted job's callback has RETURNED. Returning while a delivery is
 *    still in progress is not a race an in-process fake can expose (a fake
 *    delivers inline, so its counter is always already settled) but it
 *    silently loses results on real hardware, where the callback runs on
 *    the runtime's own thread.
 *
 * The asynchronous executor nonetheless catches around submit() and
 * flush(), so a future implementation that violates this contract degrades
 * to a reported node error instead of terminating the process.
 *
 * ORIGIN CONTRACT (NORMATIVE). Every result a stage returns - from run(),
 * and in every submit() callback - must carry `result.origin =
 * input.origin`, copied verbatim. The executors do not stamp it: they hand
 * the origin in and read it back out. `origin.inv_align` maps the result's
 * coordinates back to the source frame - the identity on the source frame,
 * a scale after a hand-off, the crop's own mapping for a ROI job - so a
 * stage that drops or rebuilds it reports, serializes and draws a detector
 * after super-resolution at the wrong place. `parent_node`, `parent_index`
 * and `roi_index` are the key both executors sort a node's ROI results by
 * (ByOrigin) before storing them, so a stage that loses them breaks the ROI
 * ordering that sync/async parity relies on.
 *
 * PORTS CONTRACT (NORMATIVE). A model may declare extra outputs in
 * ModelInfo::ports; its primary output stays `result.data` and is named
 * ToString(outputShape()). On success `result.ports` holds exactly one
 * non-null payload per declared port, of the declared shape, and nothing
 * else; a failed result carries no ports. The executors copy ports verbatim
 * and hand a port's payload along an edge whose "port" names it. A model
 * that declares no ports leaves `ports` empty and is reported exactly as
 * before ports existed.
 *
 * THREADING (NORMATIVE). Callers were relying on folklore here - on what
 * common/runner/'s idiom happens to do - and folklore is not a basis for
 * memory safety, so the rules are written down. This section is written for
 * someone with no access to this project's implementation: a plugin author
 * behind the dlopen registry, and a factory author whose preprocessor and
 * postprocessor a stage will call.
 *
 * (1) WHICH CALLS THE CALLER SERIALIZES.
 *     The caller serializes every call it makes INTO one IStage instance:
 *     run(), submit(), flush() and poll() on a single stage are never invoked
 *     concurrently, with each other or with themselves. That is a promise,
 *     not an accident of how the executors happen to be written, and an
 *     implementation may rely on it - per-stage scratch used only inside
 *     those calls (a preprocessor, an input buffer, a shape cache) needs no
 *     lock. Two things are NOT covered by it: different IStage instances
 *     are driven concurrently, so anything shared BETWEEN stages must be
 *     synchronized; and a completion callback can run at any time during
 *     any of these calls, so state touched by BOTH a method and a callback
 *     is still shared state (see (3)).
 *
 * (2) WHICH THREAD RUNS WHAT. Three separate questions with three
 *     different answers. A factory author who collapses them into one will
 *     write a postprocessor that is unsafe in exactly the way that is
 *     hardest to reproduce:
 *
 *      - The PREPROCESSOR runs on the thread that called run() or submit(),
 *        inside that call, and is therefore serialized by (1).
 *      - The POSTPROCESSOR need not. A stage backed by an asynchronous
 *        runtime decodes the output where the runtime hands it over - the
 *        runtime's completion thread - and it does so for run() JUST AS
 *        MUCH AS for submit(), because the result reaches such a stage only
 *        through the completion path in both cases. A postprocessor must
 *        therefore be safe to run on a thread that is not the caller's, and
 *        must not assume it is the same thread that ran the preprocessor.
 *      - DELIVERY is the third question, and "run() delivers on the calling
 *        thread" answers only that one. run() returns its result to its own
 *        caller and never reports through a StageCallback. A StageCallback
 *        passed to submit() may be invoked on ANY thread, typically one the
 *        runtime owns and the caller never created, and may be invoked
 *        INLINE, before submit() returns, when the submission fails early
 *        enough.
 *
 * (3) CALLBACK CONCURRENCY.
 *     Callbacks are NOT guaranteed to be serialized with each other. Two
 *     completions from one stage may run CONCURRENTLY. Whatever a callback
 *     writes into must therefore be safe against itself: the underlying
 *     runtime here (dxrt::InferenceEngine::RegisterCallback) documents no
 *     threading guarantee at all, and assuming one costs memory corruption
 *     rather than a clean failure when it turns out to be wrong.
 *
 * (4) FLUSH IS THE ORDERING POINT.
 *     flush() returns only after every callback submitted to that stage has
 *     RETURNED, and it establishes a happens-before edge, so everything
 *     those callbacks wrote is visible to the thread that called flush().
 *     That is the ONLY ordering guarantee this interface gives.
 *
 * (5) DESTRUCTION.
 *     Destroying a stage with work outstanding is the IMPLEMENTATION's
 *     problem, not the caller's: ~IStage must not return while a callback
 *     can still fire. It waits for every outstanding completion and detaches
 *     itself from the runtime BEFORE any member a callback touches is
 *     destroyed - note that members are otherwise torn down in reverse
 *     declaration order, which will free a mutex the callback still needs
 *     while the runtime handle that can still invoke it is alive. Two
 *     mirror-image obligations fall on the caller: it must not destroy a
 *     stage from inside that stage's own callback (the destructor's wait
 *     would deadlock against the callback it is waiting for), and it must
 *     not read destruction as cancellation - destruction BLOCKS on
 *     outstanding work. Calling flush() first is not required; it only
 *     moves that cost to a line where it is visible.
 *
 *     DESTRUCTION JOINS CLAUSE (1)'s SERIALIZED SET. ~IStage is not an
 *     extra concurrent entry point: the caller must not destroy a stage
 *     while any call into it is in progress, on its own thread or another.
 *     A flush() running on a second thread when the destructor starts is
 *     undefined, and undefined in the worst way - the destructor tears down
 *     the very mutex and condition variable that call is blocked on. The
 *     ONE thing that may legitimately still be outstanding when the
 *     destructor is entered is a completion callback, because waiting for
 *     those is exactly the destructor's job.
 *
 * (6) PROGRESS.
 *     Every job accepted by submit() must eventually have its callback
 *     invoked, either on the stage's own initiative (a runtime completion
 *     thread, as this project's hardware stage does) or during a call to
 *     poll(). A stage must NOT require flush() for a callback to fire: the
 *     asynchronous executor keeps several frames' jobs outstanding on one
 *     stage and harvests them as they complete, and flush() waits for ALL
 *     of them, so a flush-driven harvest would serialize every frame
 *     behind the slowest. poll() never blocks, is called only by the
 *     driver thread (clause (1)), and may run callbacks inline. A stage
 *     that pushes its own callbacks leaves poll() as the no-op default; a
 *     batching stage that runs deferred work when asked is conforming as
 *     long as poll() is what asks.
 *
 * What an IMPLEMENTATION must provide: exactly the above. In particular it
 * must not serialize callbacks on the caller's behalf (a caller that needs
 * serialization must do its own locking), and it must not hold an internal
 * lock across the user callback, which would let a callback that calls
 * back into the stage deadlock.
 *
 * Those two rules pull in opposite directions, and the resolution is worth
 * stating because getting it wrong is silent. Clause (3) means a stage that
 * decodes on the completion path must protect whatever that decoding
 * touches - typically ONE postprocessor instance shared by every job, which
 * the framework's IPostprocessor does not promise is reentrant. The lock
 * that protects it must be a SEPARATE lock, scoped to the decode alone, not
 * the lock the stage uses for its own bookkeeping: reuse it and the stage
 * ends up holding it across the user callback, which is the very thing the
 * paragraph above forbids. Serializing the decode also keeps a result from
 * depending on the order completions happened to arrive in, which would
 * otherwise surface as an executor parity failure whose cause is in a
 * factory.
