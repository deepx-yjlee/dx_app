/**
 * @brief Canonical order for a node's ROI results.
 *
 * Orders by (parent_node, parent_index, roi_index), ascending. A node's ROI
 * results can arrive in whatever order its producer(s) emitted them in
 * (RouteRois sorts by score for the max-cut step, not by index; a node with
 * two ROI parents interleaves both producers' crops in producer-processing
 * order) — this is the single comparator both executors sort into before
 * storing roi_results, so Task 10's parity test compares like-ordered
 * vectors regardless of either executor's internal delivery order. Declared
 * here, not duplicated per executor, so sync and async cannot drift apart
 * on what "canonical order" means.
 *
 * Tie safety (review round 3, item 1): a full three-way tie — same
 * parent_node AND same parent_index AND same roi_index — would leave
 * std::stable_sort's output order dependent on delivery order, which is
 * exactly what a parity comparator must not depend on. That tie cannot
 * occur for any node in a validated graph: matching on parent_node alone
 * already requires two crops in one node's inbox to have arrived via two
 * edges sharing the same "from", and combined with the shared "to" (the
 * consumer whose inbox they share), that is exactly the duplicate
 * (from, to) edge pair ValidateGraph rejects unconditionally, regardless of
 * each edge's "roi" contents (graph_config.cpp:417-424, thrown as
 * kGraphSchema "duplicate edge"). Pinned by the existing
 * TestValidateRejectsDuplicateEdge (graph_engine_test.cpp:906-920), whose
 * fixture is precisely two ROI edges from one parent into one consumer —
 * the exact shape that would otherwise produce this tie. Build() is
 * documented to run only on a validated GraphSpec (see its own kModelUnknown
 * guard's comment), so ByOrigin can rely on this rejection without adding a
 * source-edge discriminator to RoiRef.
