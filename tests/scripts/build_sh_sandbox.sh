#!/bin/bash
# Run a copy of build.sh inside a throwaway tree, with cmake, ninja, column,
# python3 and sudo replaced by stubs that record what they were given.
#
#   build_sh_sandbox.sh <build.sh to test> <sandbox dir> [build.sh args...]
#
# Layout it creates:
#   <sandbox>/repo     build.sh, the scripts it sources, the toolchain files,
#                      and fake build_x86_64/ build_aarch64/ bin/ lib/ include/
#                      trees, each holding a file named "marker"; the two
#                      build trees also hold release/marker
#   <sandbox>/fakebin  the stubs, first on PATH for the build.sh run
#   <sandbox>/log      cmake_argv (NUL-separated argv of the FIRST cmake call,
#                      the configure), cmake_calls (one line per cmake call),
#                      ninja (one line per ninja call), sudo (one line per
#                      call), python3, rm_denied, stdout (build.sh stdout+
#                      stderr), rc (its exit status)
#
# By default the cmake stub fails, so build.sh stops right after the
# configure call: the clean step and the configure command line are all
# that run.
#
# Environment:
#   SANDBOX_RM_FAILS=1       rm fails unless run through the sudo stub
#                            (exercises build.sh's sudo retry)
#   SANDBOX_TRACE=1          run build.sh under `bash -x` (trace in log/stdout)
#   SANDBOX_CMAKE_RC=<n>     exit status of every cmake call (default 1)
#   SANDBOX_NINJA_TARGETS=.. what `ninja -t targets` prints (default: a few
#                            phony targets and build.ninja)
#   SANDBOX_SRC_TREE=1       repo/src/cpp_example/ holds a symlink to each real
#                            category directory (the resolver reads them;
#                            nothing writes through them), and repo/run_demo.sh
#                            is a copy of the real one
#   SANDBOX_EMPTY_CATEGORY=<name>
#                            also a real, empty repo/src/cpp_example/<name>/
#   SANDBOX_INSTALL_TREE=1   a "cmake --build" call creates release/bin/ in the
#                            build dir (as an install would), and
#                            repo/src/bindings/python/dx_postprocess/ exists
#
# Never touches the real repository: every path is under <sandbox>.
