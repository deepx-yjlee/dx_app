"""Every published model resolves from the runners' auto-download selectors.

An example run without ``-m`` that finds its model missing calls
``setup_sample_models.sh --models <selector>``, which hands the selector to
``scripts/download_models.py``:

* the C++ runners pass the registry ``model_name`` (``resolveExampleModel``);
* the Python runners pass the ``.dxnn`` stem (``Path(dxnn_file).stem``).

For every registry row with ``published: true``, each selector must select
exactly one manifest entry, and that entry must download the row's
``dxnn_file``. Rows that are not published are listed with their reason (run
with ``-s``); none of them may have a downloadable manifest entry.

Hermetic: the downloader's own matcher runs on the committed manifest and
registry. Nothing is downloaded and nothing is written.
