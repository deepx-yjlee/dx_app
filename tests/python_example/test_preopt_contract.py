"""The pre-optimized output contract, checked against the NPU.

Run as a subprocess, not in-process: ``conftest.py`` installs a Mock for ``dx_engine``
during ``pytest_configure``, which is what the unit tests want and the opposite of
what a hardware test needs. ``scripts/verify_preopt_contract.py`` holds the actual
check; this file is the pytest entry point for it, and it skips rather than fails when
the pre-optimized models are not on this machine.

Why it matters: 63 of the 147 DX Model Zoo 2_5_0 additions are pre-optimized YOLO
models whose .dxnn files are not published yet, so they cannot be run individually.
They share exactly three output contracts, and dx_yolo26 ships one real model for each
-- so this is the only hardware evidence that group can have, and it covers all of it.
