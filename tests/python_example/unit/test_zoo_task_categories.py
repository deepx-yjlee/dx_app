"""The zoo page's task column is the authority for which task an example lives under.

DX Model Zoo 2_5_0 introduced four categories that had no directory here, and every
model in them was filed under whatever the legacy task tables could accommodate. The
worst of it was not cosmetic: both EigenPlaces variants and PP-ShiTuV2 sat in
``super_resolution``, with ``default_image`` pointing at ``sample/img/face_pair`` -- a
place-recognition model aimed at a pair of face photographs.

    Image Retrieval           clip-text_resnet50_77x512_openai
    Image Matting             ppmatting-hrnet-w48-{composition,distinctions}_512x512
    Visual Place Recognition  eigenplaces-resnet{18,50}_512x512
                              pp-shituv2-feature-extraction_224x224
    Person ReID               repvgg-a0-reid_256x128

These tests read the page and pin the assignment, so the next re-classification cannot
quietly regress it. The page is not committed, so they skip when it is absent.

ONE DELIBERATE DEPARTURE, asserted rather than tolerated:
``clip-img_resnet50_224x224_openai``. The page lists it under Zero Shot Image
Classification, and it lives under ``image_retrieval`` instead, because retrieval needs
both halves of one embedding space and this is the text tower's own OpenAI RN50 pair.
It also had no working example anywhere before the move -- its config applied open_clip
mean/std to a .dxnn whose input is uint8, which the engine rejects outright, and the
prompt bank beside it is 512-d ViT-B/32 against this model's 1024-d output.
