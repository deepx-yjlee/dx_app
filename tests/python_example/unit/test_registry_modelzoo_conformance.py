"""``config/model_registry.json`` must agree with the vendored dx-modelzoo tree.

The registry is the single source of truth for (task, family, variant). Family
assignment cannot be derived -- dx-modelzoo folds depth/width into the family
(resnet50 -> resnet, vgg16-bn -> vgg) -- so it is joined in from a committed
snapshot of the upstream tree and pinned here. Without this test the mapping
drifts silently the first time either side gains a model.

``variant`` is the identity used by ``--variant`` and by
``assets/models/<variant>.dxnn``; the four entries where it cannot equal the
dxnn stem are enumerated in EXCEPTIONS and nowhere else.
